"AGGIUNGI UN POSTO A TAVOLA
In principio sembra di essere dentro “I Remember” di Joe Brainard, magari nella versione transalpina di George Perec, “Je me souviens” **.
Ma la sensazione è breve, solo le prime poche pagine: poi, gli elenchi, e le liste dei ricordi si fermano, lasciano posto a una memoria più collettiva, che però non trascura mai il punto di vista personale.
Non è un ‘io’ che ricorda e racconta, ma un ‘noi’. Un plurale che abbraccia e coinvolge, tutti.
È l’unione tra esperienza individuale ed esperienza storica, tra storia e Storia, tra micro e Macro.
Il ricordo s’interseca e si mischia con la memoria, si sostengono e nutrono a vicenda, la crescita del singolo è parte delle trasformazioni che coinvolgono il Noi.
Annie Ernaux racconta il nostro tempo, e così facendo, scrive la nostra vita insieme alla sua.
È come leggere il proprio diario scritto da qualcun che scrive molto meglio di noi. È come immergersi nel proprio passato e presente, è come vivere e ripercorrere il proprio tempo.
Per quanto riguarda la sua esistenza, quando il ‘noi’ diventa un ‘io’, espresso però attraverso un ‘lei’ che sembra allontanare e ridimensionare l’urgenza del soggetto, della sua personale vicenda Annie Ernaux seleziona parecchio e tralascia tutto il racconto della sua carriera artistica. Che l’io/lei che si esprime sia anche una grande scrittrice è lasciato fuori.
È però ben presente il percorso di formazione di questo testo specifico, lungo decenni, faticoso, ragionato, iniziato forse più volte, e forse più volte abbandonato, ma sempre tenuto vicino, sempre sentito importante, vitale, urgente: nonostante la lentezza e lunghezza del processo di composizione narrativa, attestato più volte all’interno de “Gli Anni”, si percepisce una tensione e una necessità che ha qualcosa di erotico.
Il ricordo prende il via dai pranzi domenicali della famiglia, ripetuti ritmicamente nel tempo, momento collettivo per antonomasia: i nonni e i genitori quando chi scrive è ancora figlia, che poi diventa adulta, incontra un uomo, e i nonni se ne sono andati per lasciare il posto a tavola a nuovi arrivati, che man mano diventano i figli della scrittrice, da figlia diventata madre, e poi i nipoti divenuti adulti, la vita si ripete e continua attraverso gli incontri intorno a un desco.
Il ricordo si nutre anche delle fotografie di famiglia: i passaggi di tempo, lo scorrere degli eventi è scandito dalle fotografie che Ernaux descrive, così come dai pasti dei giorni di festa che racconta.
Scrittura lenta, e lettura profonda.
Scrittura neutra, quasi obiettiva, che non giudica, non impone valutazioni, senza condanne e senza metafore, tesa a restare all’interno del confine dei fatti e delle cose: supermercati, mezzi pubblici, prodotti commerciali e oggetti di consumo sono parte fondamentale della memoria tanto quanto aspetti del vivere solitamente considerati più degni, più ‘alti’.
Il libro si chiude su una frase particolarmente significativa che condensa l’intento letterario di Annie Ernaux:
Salvare qualcosa del tempo in cui non saremo mai più, salvare le immagini che scompariranno
Un libro bello. Molto bello.
Secondo me, anche importante. Prezioso.
Un libro che mette i brividi.
Un libro che fa sognare.
Un libro che abita il tempo, e la memoria.
**
Gli elenchi sono ormai strumento banalizzato, se ne è persino appropriata la televisione.
Ma le liste dei modi di dire, del lessico comune che rappresenta un periodo, un determinato tempo, sono rari e magnifici, e ho l’impressione che resteranno nel futuro così come ci sono arrivati i caratteri cuneiformi, e saranno meritevoli di essere conservati e riscoperti, ci rappresenteranno come i geroglifici hanno fatto per gli antichi egiziani.","Orsodimondo"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"Permítanme que, como Ernaux, empiece con una cita de Chéjov:
“Lo que querría es salvarlo todo, lo que ha existido alrededor suyo, continuamente, salvar su circunstancia.”
De esto se trata, de dejar constancia de una vida individual en el contexto social y sentimental en el que esta sucedió, “salvar algo del tiempo en el que ya no estaremos nunca más”, el mismo objetivo de Proust, uno de sus autores preferidos, aunque, obviamente, no comparta ni mirada ni experiencia vital ni estilo, lento, detallista, sentimental y laberíntico el de uno, seco, cortante, distante y directo el de la otra.
“Una de las grandes cuestiones susceptibles de hacer que avance el conocimiento de sí es la posibilidad o la imposibilidad de determinar cómo, en cada edad, cada año de la existencia, se representa uno el pasado.”
Y así es como ella procede en esta nueva entrega, nueva para mí, de Ernaux: una sucesión de párrafos cortos sobre un sinfín de detalles de su vida personal y colectiva a lo largo de más de sesenta años, y como esos recuerdos, así como la idea que iba teniendo de sí misma y de sus futuros deseados en cada uno de los presentes, han ido también cambiando a lo largo de Los años.
Verdaderamente, envidio al público francés coetáneo de la autora por este documento sobre la Francia post Segunda Guerra Mundial. Aunque el mundo se haya ido globalizando y todos los occidentales compartamos muchos de los hechos históricos y los procesos sociales y políticos que se han ido produciendo, aquellos que no hemos vivido en Francia durante Los años no podemos tener con la autora la complicidad que conlleva esa memoria sentimental compartida repleta de noticias locales, personajes políticos, intelectuales, libros, películas, actores y actrices, canciones, artistas, famosillos, víctimas de horribles o simpáticos sucesos, eslóganes, anuncios o programas de radio y televisión, multitud de iconos que solo pertenecen a una generación en un tiempo y en un espacio concreto. Y, aunque no me considero ese tipo de lector que necesita imperiosamente identificarse de alguna forma con la historia leída, me habría encantado compartir toda esa carga sentimental con la autora.
“Todo se borrará en un segundo. El diccionario acumulado de la cuna hasta el lecho de muerte se eliminará. Llegará el silencio y no habrá palabras para decirlo. De la boca abierta no saldrá nada. Ni yo ni mí. La lengua seguirá poniendo el mundo en palabras. En las conversaciones en torno a una mesa familiar seremos tan solo un nombre, cada vez más sin rostro, hasta desaparecer en la masa anónima de una generación remota”.
No obstante, he caminado gustoso a su lado durante todo su periplo personal, una historia marcada por victorias que terminaron convirtiéndose en derrotas: empezando por su paso por la universidad que acabó por sentir como la ruptura con su mundo de origen, las grandes ilusiones y decepciones políticas —mayo del 68, Mitterrand, la igualdad entre hombres y mujeres (creo que las mujeres también lo disfrutarán aún más que nosotros)…—, su matrimonio, la llegada de nuevos tiempos en los que “la profusión de cosas escondía la escasez de ideas y el desgaste de las creencias”, hasta ese momento en el que nos damos cuenta que hemos pasado de relegar a nuestros padres por haberse quedados anclados en el pasado a ser arrinconados por nuestros hijos que, al igual que nosotros unos años antes, en la seguridad de saberlo todo de la vida, se burlan de nuestra incompetencia y de nuestras trasnochadas ideas sobre casi todo, hasta ese momento, vivido como la derrota definitiva, en el que somos conscientes de que el futuro ha dejado de ser un “espacio de fondo ilimitado”.
“Le invadía la vieja impresión de sentirse fuera de la fiesta.”
Una novela de derrotas que sin embargo termina con una gran victoria, la escritura de esta novela para la que tanto esfuerzo gastó durante años hasta encontrar la forma definitiva y que consiguió salvando tanto a una tercera persona con su “demasiada exterioridad, alejamiento” como a la primera y su “demasiada permanencia, estrechez, asfixia” y con la que consigue emocionar sin buscarlo, invitándonos e incitándonos a repasar también nuestra vida y volver a aquellos hechos, propios y colectivos, que marcaron las etapas de nuestra historia y así, como la autora, poder “unir esas múltiples imágenes de ella, separadas, desajustadas, mediante el hilo de un relato, el de su existencia”.","Guille"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"müthiş, müthiş bir kitap. uzun süredir bu kadar etkilendiğim bir şey olmamıştı.
otobiyografik ama anlatım tarzıyla değil.
kişisel ama inanılmaz politik.
neyi neden yaptığını açıklıyor ama nasıl bu kadar ustalıkla yapabildiğine akıl sır erdiremiyoruz.
1940'lardan 2010'lara kadarki değişimin fotoğraflar öncülüğünde, anılarla, ders kitabı, film, roman, tv programları, gazeteler, seçimler, ölümler eşliğinde gözümüzün önünde akıp gitmesi.
okuduğum süre boyunca türkiye'yle karşılaştırdım bir de. fransa'da 60'lardan itibaren yaşanan tüketim çılgınlığının, bizde nasıl 90'larda başladığı ve 2000'lerde tüm dünyanın bu konuda nasıl eşitlendiği... teknolojinin nasıl ayak uydurulamaz bir boyuta geldiği... ölüm kalım savaşı seçimlerin hayatımızdaki etkisi... nasıl benziyor her şey.
ve annie ernaux acaba şu pandemiyi nasıl anlatırdı? öyle merak ediyorum ki.
küçücük bir kız çocuktan, adet gören genç kıza, hamile kalmamaya çalışan üniversiteliye, 2 çocuk bakmaya çalışan evli bir kadına, sonrasında boşanmış bekar bir anneye, yaş almış ama kendisini hiç değişmemiş gören olgun bir kadına, büyükanneye dönüşümü anlatan politik, tarihsel bir başyapıt bence. ve kadınlık nasıl aynı aslında her yerde...
sık sık jonathan coe'nun ""yağmurdan önce""sini hatırladım. fotoğraf bağı oldukça benzer ama o kadar tabii.
ve siren idemen sanki ernaux'ya kitabı türkçe yazdırmış. öyle iyi bir çeviri.","Banu Yıldıran Genç"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.

"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"bir dönem romanı desen değil, otobiyografi desen? eh, tam değil; hem kişisel hem hiç değil... ne kadar farklı bir üslup, ne kadar farklı bir tür. bayıldım. itiraf edeyim başlarda “n’oluyor ya?” diye okudum ama sonra elimden bırakamaz oldum. 1940’lardan yanılmıyorsam 2006’ya kadar fransa çerçevesinde birçok konuda insanlık olarak neler düşünmüşüz, nasıl davranmışız bunları okudum aslında. kadınlar, direnişler, mülteciler, savaşlar, gençler... tabi “gelişmekte olan” bir ülke vatandaşı olarak benzer aşamaları birkaç on yıl geriden takip edince ister istemez bizim jenerasyonun türkiye’deki halini bile gördüm kaç yıl öncesinin fransa’sında. zaten kitapla ilgili hayıflandığım tek şey türk bir yazar tarafından yazılmamış olması. şu kitaptaki her bir kitabı, filmi, reklamı, ne bileyim siyasetçiyi tanıyarak, google’da bakınmaya gerek duymadan, her bir göndermeyi anında anlayarak okuduğunuzu düşünsenize. bunu yaşayamamış olmama rağmen bayıldım. yani yazarın bu kadar kişisel bir anlatıyı bu kadar kendinden uzak anlatabilmesine ve bu kadar dönemiyle birlikte, o havayı solutarak ilerletmesine hayran kaldım. beklentim çok mu yükseldi diye korkmuştum kitap ilk basıldığında yaşanan heyecanın gazına gelip alırken ama az bile yükselmiş. müthiş.","Sine"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Övüldüğü kadar varmış, bayıldım. Bir kere teknik olarak müthiş: hiç “ben” demeden bir otobiyografi yazmayı becermiş Annie Ernaux. Kişisel deneyimini toplumsal, sosyolojik ve politik olanla ne kadar müthiş harmanlamış. Okurken sık sık aklıma Boğaziçi’nde birinci sınıfın birinci döneminin ilk dersinde bize söylenen ve sonra da unutmamamız için sıkça hatırlatılan “her şey politiktir” cümlesi geldi. 1940lardan 2006’ya dek uzanan bir zaman diliminde değişen Fransa ve dünya ve bunlarla beraber dönüşen kadın olma, hayatı deneyimleme, kendini tanımlama deneyimini anlatıyor Ernaux. Toplumsal hafızayla bireysel tecrübeyi bu zariflikle harmanlayan kitap bulmak çok zor. Sanırım kitabın son cümlesini aslında kitabın yazılma sebebi olarak okuyabiliriz: “artık asla olmayacağımız zamandan bir şey kurtarmak.” (Aklınıza Proust gelmiş olabilir, doğrudur, sıkça Proust göndermesi göreceksiniz zaten.) Kitabı yavaş yavaş okumak istedim ama yapamadım, bırakamadım zira – fakat hayatımın çeşitli dönemlerinde, kendi farklı “seneler”imde dönüp tekrar okuyacağıma ve Ernaux’nun tecrübesine ve yol arkadaşlığına ihtiyaç duyacağıma eminim. Çok etkilendim, aşırı hararetle öneriyorum ve Can Yayınları’nın basacağı yeni Ernauxları heyecanla bekliyorum. Şu çok tanıdık pasajı da buraya bırakıyorum: “(Protesto yürüyüşlerinden sonra) rozetleri eve dönüşte hatıra olarak çekmeceye koyuyorduk. İçeriğini unuttuğumuz dilekçelere imza atıyorduk, hatta imzaladığımızı unuttuğumuz bile oluyordu. (…) İnsanlar bugünden yarına yorgun düşüyordu. Coşkunun ardından dermansızlık, itirazın ardından rıza geliyordu. “Mücadele”, eğlence konusu haline gelen Marksizmin kokusunun üzerine sindiği bir kelime olarak itibarsızlaşmış, “hak savunuculuğu”ndan öncelikle tüketici hakları anlaşılır olmuştu.”","Eylül Görmüş"
"Salvar qualquer coisa do tempo onde não voltaremos a estar.
Este livro de Annie Ernaux deixou-me mal-humorada, e não era esse o efeito que eu esperava num livro tão aclamado. Talvez quem seja mais francófilo do que eu consiga retirar mais das infinitas referências culturais e históricas, mas para mim, “Os Anos” vive essencialmente do cinismo da autora e de um aborrecido “name-dropping”: listas e listas de marcas, locais, livros, filmes, canções, políticos, actores e outras personalidades. Abarcando um período que vai desde a Segunda Guerra até ao início do século XXI, salientando o mais significativo dos anos mais marcantes, o estilo almanaque desta obra não me conquistou.
A obra é escrita na terceira pessoa do singular, na primeira do plural e, menos frequentemente, na terceira pessoa do plural.
Nenhum “eu” na enunciação do que ela vê como uma espécie de autobiografia impessoal. Mas, antes”, “alguém” e “nós”, como se fosse agora a sua vez de contar os dias de um tempo anterior comum.
Sempre que a narrativa se foca no “ela”, Ernaux maravilhou-me. Consegue criar alguma distância de si mesma e ver-se fora do seu corpo e da sua vida, com passagens introspectivas e nostálgicas de grande clarividência.
Portanto, o livro a fazer era um instrumento de luta. Nunca abandonou esta ambição, mas agora, acima de tudo, gostaria de captar a luz que inunda rostos doravante invisíveis, toalhas de mesa cheias de comida desaparecida, essa luz que já lá estava, dentro das narrativas dos domingos de infância, e nunca mais deixou de descer sobre as coisas no momento em que são vividas – uma luz de outrora.
Quando usa a voz do “nós”, acho-o um exercício arrogante e redutor. Ao falar em nome de toda uma geração acaba por cair em generalizações e ideias feitas, que ainda se agudizam mais quando se refere a “eles”, numa demarcação clara de um grupo que desdenha e onde não se inclui.
Este é o terceiro livro que leio de Annie Ernaux, portanto, sei que ela é brusca e frontal, mas custou-me ler a forma deselegante como ela se refere a Simone de Beauvoir. Ainda que eu saiba que todos os santos têm pés de barro, achei mesquinho da parte de Ernaux só se referir a esse grande nome do feminismo troçando do seu aspecto, inclusive no funeral de Sartre, onde a autora já contava com 72 anos.
Quanto a Sartre, em cuja morte já tínhamos pensado antes, ela mostrou-se com grande pompa, um milhão de pessoas a desfilar atrás do caixão e o turbante de Simone de Beauvoir a deslizar no momento da descida à terra.
Talvez depois desta leitura eu esteja contaminada pelo chauvinismo de que acusam os franceses, mas “Os Anos” é de tal forma centrado na cultura francesa e na visão que a autora quer dar ao seu livro, que no ano de 1974, diz ela que “já nada acontecia na primavera, fosse em Paris ou em Praga”, esquecendo que, nessa mesma Primavera, houve uma revolução dois países ao lado, porque isso, claramente, não encaixa na sua narrativa derrotista. A narrativa de Ernaux é a do desencanto, a da amargura, a ideia de que as esperanças do pós-guerra saíram defraudas e que os ideais do Maio de 68 não vingaram porque somos todos uns burgueses e uns consumistas, que preferimos passar os fins de semana nos centros comerciais e pôr os filhos à frente de dispositivos eletrónicos que lhes tiraram a vontade de ler.
Abríamos os olhos e víamos uma mulher, completamente vestida a entrar no mar, com um casaco, saia comprida e um lenço muçulmano a cobrir-lhe a cabeça. Um homem, de tronco nu e calções, segurava-a pela mão. Era uma visão bíblica cuja beleza se transformava em nós numa emoção assustadora e livre.","Paula Mota"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"

"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"Satın alıp ama bir yıldan fazladır okuyamadığım bu kitabı, Ernaux’ya Nobel ödülünün verilmesi vesilesiyle sonunda elime alabildim. Müthiş ve farklı bir kitap. Kişisel, toplumsal ve siyasal tarihin etkileyici bir şekilde harmanlandığı bir anlatı. 1940’lardan 2000’li yıllara yaşananlara, dönüşümlere ışık tutan bir metin. Belki biraz fazla Fransız ama işlenen temalar evrensel; dolayısıyla Fransız tarihine, kültürüne yabancı olmanız kitaptan aldığınız zevki pek etkilemiyor.
“Bütün görüntüler yok olup gidecek” diye başlayıp, “Artık asla olmayacağımız zamandan bir şey kurtarmak” diye bitiriyor. “Kolektif tarihin bireysel hafızanın
perdesine aksettirdiği yansımayı”, “şimdi her şeyden çok istediği, artık bir daha göremeyeceğimiz yüzlere vuran ışığı yakalamak, yok olmuş yiyeceklerle dolu sofralara vuran, çocukluğunun pazar anlatılarında orada olan, yaşanmış şeylerin üzerine her daim vurmaya devam eden o ışığı, kadim ışığı” yakalamaya, kurtarmaya çalıştığını yazıyor ve bunu harika bir şekilde başarıyor Ernaux.
Muazzam bir tüketim toplumu eleştirisi de var:
“İnsanlarin, sahip olduklar nesneler sayesinde hayatlarının iyileştiğine ve güzelleştiğine inancı gitgide artıyordu.”
“Gittikçe daha hızlı ve daha çok yeni şeyin hayatımıza girmesi, geçmisi geriye atıyordu. İnsanlar bütün bu nesnelerin bir işe yarayıp yaramadığını, onlara ihtiyaç duyup duymadıklarını sorgulamıyor, sadece sahip olmayı arzuluyor ve hepsini derhal almaya yetecek kadar para kazanamamanın sıkıntısını çekiyorlardı.”
“Şeylerin bolluğu, fikirlerin kıtlığını ve inançların aşınmasını gizliyordu.”
Bu konularla sınırlı değil tabii, daha da fazlası (kadın olmak, anne olmak, cinsellik, kuşaklar arası farklılıklar, aile dinamikleri, toplumsal hafızanın seyri, göçmenlik, terör… vs) var kitapta. Okuyun derim. Siren İdemen’in çevirisi de çok iyi.","Hakan"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"«Sto per compiere cinquant'anni, sarebbe ora di sapere chi sono.»
Annie Ernaux abbandona l'autobiografico intimista per sconfinare nell'autobiografia collettiva e farsi coro, voce narrante di un'epoca.
L'io diventa noi, le foto in bianco e nero di famiglia, che la ritraggono in varie fasi della vita sin da quand'era bambina, fino al passaggio a quelle a colori (e dai filmini super8 alle cassette Vhs) riflettono la sua storia individuale e al tempo stesso diventano specchio dei mutamenti collettivi della Francia e del popolo francese.
Dal secondo dopoguerra, durante il quale, dopo un primo momento di choc, tutti, vecchie e nuove generazioni, hanno fretta di sbarazzarsi dei ricordi dei tempi di guerra come colti da una postuma amnesia collettiva, agli anni del benessere e della modernità e del materialismo e dal senso smisurato e salvifico del possedere e accumulare cose - «eravamo presi da un desiderio assillante di comprare, come se l'acquisto di una cialdiera elettrica o di una lampada giapponese dovesse fare di noi esseri differenti» -, in primis la TV, che entra con prepotenza in tutte le case - Era finita l'epoca dell'ingenuità sociale, e la televisione entrava in tutte le case - Solo i fatti mostrati in televisione davano accesso alla realtà - ""l'ha detto la TV"" - al post colonialismo e alle rivolte nelle banlieu dei beurs, che pone di fronte a un esame di coscienza sociale e individuale, dal Maggio francese a Charlie Hebdo in ogni casa della bourgeoisie, dall'Algeria e al Vietnam, dalla caduta del Muro all'ex Jugoslavia e all'ex Unione Sovietica, dalle guerre del Golfo all'11 settembre - a New York era mattina, ma per noi sarebbe per sempre rimasto pomeriggio - da Giscard d'Estaing a François Mitterand, da Jospin a Le Pen, dalla conquista e alla scoperta di ogni donna della propria capacità di autonomia nella società e nella famiglia, dalla pillola al divorzio e alla libertà sessuale, dall'aborto alla maternità, dalla lunghezza delle gonne che si accorciano e si allungano allo stesso modo in cui si accorciano e si allungano i capelli, dall'ecologismo all'Euro e alla globalizzazione, dalla Storia che passa per le storie, dall'io passando per il noi, Annie Ernaux tratteggia l'autobiografia di un popolo intero.
E la sua scrittura è anche qui, ancora una volta come nello splendido Il posto (ma anche nel tessere nuovamente il filo che lo unisce a L'onta e agli altri suoi scritti, che hanno sempre una matrice autobiografica, come Gli armadi vuoti) una scrittura analitica, tagliente, distaccata, chirurgica, che impietosamente, ma con un filo di asciutta nostalgia, (auto)critica il progressivo allontanamento dalle antiche aspirazioni sociali e, nell'imborghesimento, la dimenticanza delle origini: la memoria si faceva più corta, il legame con il passato si faceva sfocato. Trasmettevamo - ammette Annie Ernaux - solo il presente.
Gli avvenimenti storici, pagina dopo pagina, anno dopo anno, le rivolte sociali, i fatti di cronaca, si legano e si collegano come un filo invisibile alla sua vita: l'adolescenza, l'università, l'aborto, il matrimonio, i figli, la morte del padre, il divorzio, l'insegnamento, la solitudine, la malattia della madre, i nuovi amori, la scrittura, questo libro, gli anni.
Alla decisione di salvare le circostanze narrando quegli anni, quella di restituire, ritrovando la memoria della memoria collettiva in una memoria individuale, la dimensione vissuta della Storia.
«Sarà una narrzione scivolosa, in un perfetto continuo, assoluto, che divori via via il presente fino all'ultima immagine di una vita. Un fluire interrotto, tuttavia, da foto e sequenze di filmati che a intervalli regolari coglieranno la forma corporea e le posizioni sociali successive del suo essere, fermi-immagine della memoria e allo stesso tempo resoconti sull'evoluzione della sua esistenza, ciò che l'ha resa singolare, non in virtù degli elementi esterni della sua vita (traiettoria sociale, profesione) o di quelli interni (pensieri e aspirazioni, desiderio di scrivere), ma per la combinazione degli uni e degli altri, unica in ciascun individuo. A questo «continuamente altro» delle foto corrisponderà, a specchio, il «lei» della scrittura».
In quella che vede come una sorta di autobiografia impersonale non ci sarà nessun «io», ma un «si» e un «noi», come se anche lei, a sua volta, svolgesse il racconto dei tempi andati.»
Tutto questo fa de Gli anni un memoir molto francese, molto europeo, molto privato, interamente nostro.
E di Annie Ernaux, per me - come ripeto ormai a tutti e ovunque - la miglior scoperta fatta nel 2014 insieme a Patrick Modiano.
«Erano in pochi / su tutta la terra / ognuno si credeva solo /furono folla a un tratto.»

"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Dit is geen raam-maar mozaïekvertelling, een geschiedenisles, een duik in ons tijdperk, een dagboek van een samenleving, een schatkist voor komende generaties. Dit is het equivalent van een schilderij wat je heel lang van dichtbij bekijkt terwijl je langzaamaan stapjes terugzet. Aan het eind zie je dat alle puntjes, strepen, vlekken en vegen een gesamtkunstwerk vormen: een canvas van duizenden details waarbij de kunstenaar in het zichzelf wegcijferen haar eigen contouren toont, zoals Borges in zijn gedicht:
Gezeten voor een muur - en niets belet
ons deze als oneindig te verbeelden -
Bereidt een man paletten en penselen
Om op de witte kalkmuur nauwgezet
De wereld af te beelden, lijn voor lijn:
Weegschalen, deuren, ankers, hyacinten,
Engelen, boekerijen, labyrinten,
't Oneindig groot en het oneindig klein.
Hij doet de vormen op de muur verrijzen.
Het lot, dat vreemde gunsten toe kan wijzen,
Vergunt hem de voltooiing van zijn daad.
Vlak voor zijn dood - zijn allerlaatste tel -
Ontdekt hij in 't immense lijnenspel
De exacte beeltenis van zijn gelaat.

"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, л��яльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"

Viena iš geriausių mano skaitytų (auto)biografijų. Prancūzų rašytoja, Annie Ernaux, labai originaliai guldo čia savo prisiminimus apie save, savo kartą ir Prancūziją nuo 1941-ųjų iki 2006-ųjų metų. Šioje autobiografijoje visiškai nesijaučia autorės asmeniškumo. Greičiausiai todėl, kad ji nenaudoja įvardžio AŠ. Vietoj jo autorė rašo Ji. Pasakodama apie savo kartą - JIE/MES...
Pats pasakojimas - chronologiškai nuoseklus, tačiau jo nuobodumą gelbsti fragmentiškumas ir labai jau žavūs atsitiktinių vaizdų, garsų, matytų filmų, girdėtų dainų nuotrupos (nors dažnai, man - ne frankomanei, ne ką sakančios), nuotraukų, kurių pačių knygoje nėra, aprašymai...
Visos tos smulkmenos, musiau, ir sukūrė tą, unikalią nuotaiką ir išskirtinį stilių...
Prancūzijoje ši knyga išleista 2008-iais, 2019 -iais m. pateko į Man Booker International trumpąjį sąrašą. Būtų puiku matyti ją išleistą lietuviškai, greičiausiai skaityčiau ją dar sykį.

There is no ''I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ''one'' and ''we'', as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time - before.","Jolanta (knygupe)"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986.

"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

[Revised 6/21/23]","Jim Fonseca"
"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.
*****************************
I had the chance to see and hear Annie Ernaux at a rare literature event at Charleston, Sussex on 29.05.2023. Julia Hartley was the (excellent) translator. Sally Rooney was the questioner
• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

I had the chance to see and hear Annie Ernaux at a rare literature event at Charleston, Sussex on 29.05.2023. Julia Hartley was the (excellent) translator. Sally Rooney was the questioner
• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are.

"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"

There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"This book is 'We Didn't Start the Fire' for people who wear too much tweed.","Richard"
"3.75/5 annie ernaux is obviously brilliant but not even she can make me care about 20th century french politics, I'm sorry","Lotte"
"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
the little village fête at Bazoches-sur-Hoène with the

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.

"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

I had the chance to see and hear Annie Ernaux at a rare literature event at Charleston, Sussex on 29.05.2023. Julia Hartley was the (excellent) translator. Sally Rooney was the questioner
• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"

All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”

The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"
"a tour-de-force, life-spanning memoir that captures not just the author's experiences but those of her entire generation in france, gorgeously written","Adrian Burger"
"a good exercise on memory and the passing of time. although semi-biographical, it felt detached at times and it was hard for me to connect and stay interested. appreciated the reflections but was bored by the sometimes long listings of media and other references","Cat"
"I am fascinated. ""The Years"" is a mesmerising book. It is a very powerful work that draws its strength from its simplicity and naturalness. Its unpolished sentences show the literary world how a text can be dazzling and magnificent while remaining raw and unpretentious.","Seyhan"
"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.
https://artsfile.ca/ex-pat-ottawa-tra...
And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”

The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"

This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her.

[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.

I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"a wonderful exploration of memory, aging and the intersection of personal & social history. i particularly loved ernaux’s preoccupation with what it means to remember/write/invent the story of one’s life and everything that entails. fair warning though this is VERY french with sooooooooo many allusions to french culture and society that went over my head","Sammy Mylan"
"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"

"a good exercise on memory and the passing of time. although semi-biographical, it felt detached at times and it was hard for me to connect and stay interested. appreciated the reflections but was bored by the sometimes long listings of media and other references","Cat"
"I am fascinated. ""The Years"" is a mesmerising book. It is a very powerful work that draws its strength from its simplicity and naturalness. Its unpolished sentences show the literary world how a text can be dazzling and magnificent while remaining raw and unpretentious.","Seyhan"
"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"

"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

I think this ! is best read in one sitting let it wash & shape","Caspar ""moved to storygraph"" Bryant"

"a wonderful exploration of memory, aging and the intersection of personal & social history. i particularly loved ernaux’s preoccupation with what it means to remember/write/invent the story of one’s life and everything that entails. fair warning though this is VERY french with sooooooooo many allusions to french culture and society that went over my head","Sammy Mylan"
"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"
"a tour-de-force, life-spanning memoir that captures not just the author's experiences but those of her entire generation in france, gorgeously written","Adrian Burger"
"a good exercise on memory and the passing of time. although semi-biographical, it felt detached at times and it was hard for me to connect and stay interested. appreciated the reflections but was bored by the sometimes long listings of media and other references","Cat"
"I am fascinated. ""The Years"" is a mesmerising book. It is a very powerful work that draws its strength from its simplicity and naturalness. Its unpolished sentences show the literary world how a text can be dazzling and magnificent while remaining raw and unpretentious.","Seyhan"
"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves.

I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"

"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"

I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"".

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"
"Everyone go to your local bookshop/library and pick up an Annie Ernaux book, any Annie Ernaux book, and allow your life to be changed forever. The enormity of this memoir is heart-rending!","Andrea"
"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"So good it almost made me like the Fr*nch","Olivia"
"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"

the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"

"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"

"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"
"Everyone go to your local bookshop/library and pick up an Annie Ernaux book, any Annie Ernaux book, and allow your life to be changed forever. The enormity of this memoir is heart-rending!","Andrea"
"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"
"this woman>>","martina&#x1fad0;"
"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"

"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"
"It does precisely what the author wants it to do: ""By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.""","Jee Koh"
"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣

I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"
"It does precisely what the author wants it to do: ""By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.""","Jee Koh"
"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it","Matthew Ted"
"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

I had the chance to see and hear Annie Ernaux at a rare literature event at Charleston, Sussex on 29.05.2023. Julia Hartley was the (excellent) translator. Sally Rooney was the questioner
• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.

I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"So good it almost made me like the Fr*nch","Olivia"
"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended.

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"

"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"

"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"
"Everyone go to your local bookshop/library and pick up an Annie Ernaux book, any Annie Ernaux book, and allow your life to be changed forever. The enormity of this memoir is heart-rending!","Andrea"
"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"
"this woman>>","martina&#x1fad0;"
"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"

"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"

"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"

"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"
"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"
"Autobiographical novel with interesting POV (with which I had some big problems) is told in snippets, from postwar years till present time.

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.

"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.

"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

[Revised 6/21/23]","Jim Fonseca"
"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.
https://artsfile.ca/ex-pat-ottawa-tra...
And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle.

[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"

Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"
"a tour-de-force, life-spanning memoir that captures not just the author's experiences but those of her entire generation in france, gorgeously written","Adrian Burger"
"a good exercise on memory and the passing of time. although semi-biographical, it felt detached at times and it was hard for me to connect and stay interested. appreciated the reflections but was bored by the sometimes long listings of media and other references","Cat"
"I am fascinated. ""The Years"" is a mesmerising book. It is a very powerful work that draws its strength from its simplicity and naturalness. Its unpolished sentences show the literary world how a text can be dazzling and magnificent while remaining raw and unpretentious.","Seyhan"
"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"I have no idea how she managed to write this. It’s amazing.","Hugo"

"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"
"a tour-de-force, life-spanning memoir that captures not just the author's experiences but those of her entire generation in france, gorgeously written","Adrian Burger"
"a good exercise on memory and the passing of time. although semi-biographical, it felt detached at times and it was hard for me to connect and stay interested. appreciated the reflections but was bored by the sometimes long listings of media and other references","Cat"
"I am fascinated. ""The Years"" is a mesmerising book. It is a very powerful work that draws its strength from its simplicity and naturalness. Its unpolished sentences show the literary world how a text can be dazzling and magnificent while remaining raw and unpretentious.","Seyhan"
"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"

I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"

"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"
"Everyone go to your local bookshop/library and pick up an Annie Ernaux book, any Annie Ernaux book, and allow your life to be changed forever. The enormity of this memoir is heart-rending!","Andrea"
"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"
"this woman>>","martina&#x1fad0;"
"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"

We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"
"It does precisely what the author wants it to do: ""By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.""","Jee Koh"
"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing.

"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details.

"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative.

These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe.

I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.)

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"

"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"Got this when I was in Paris (brag) because Annie Ernaux is so hot rn and I can absolutely see why! It's kiiind of a memoir about a woman's life from WWII up to present day, but told from a 3rd person and Royal We perspective. It was like she was examining herself from the outside, but examining society and The Way We Lived from the inside. Different and interesting!","Eric"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing.
There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.","Krys"
"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"
"Autobiographical novel with interesting POV (with which I had some big problems) is told in snippets, from postwar years till present time.

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'

This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

'but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that has was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.'","Melissa"
"Got this when I was in Paris (brag) because Annie Ernaux is so hot rn and I can absolutely see why! It's kiiind of a memoir about a woman's life from WWII up to present day, but told from a 3rd person and Royal We perspective. It was like she was examining herself from the outside, but examining society and The Way We Lived from the inside. Different and interesting!","Eric"
"my favourite book ever rn
Peak form and substance. I put it on a list with Yi Yi (2000), One Hundred Years of Solitude, (Hypernormalisation),,,
The book’s ambition, to capture an essence of the life lived, of History, is daunting and yet she does it,, and I’m grateful she did

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing.
There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.","Krys"
"Definitely, the best book I read this year. The comments here speak for themselves. Although I had no common memory or stand concerning many things that happened in France, I felt I could relate to more than I expected. We are more bound to one another than we believe. Such a pure and beautiful book","Aasecat"
"In her autobiography, ""The Years"", Annie Ernaux leads the reader down the 60 year path of her life. She uses historical events as the back drop to her story, touching on the chaos of political life in France, grappling with changes in French society, as well as accepting the ever-undulating phases in her life and that of her family, with calm and serenity. There are no chapters, but rather cleverly spaced paragraphs that indicate the continuation of commentary, the ends of thoughts, and the beginning of new years. Ernaux rebounds between pronouns, using ""she"", ""we"", ""one"", to personalize and also collectively describe events in her close life, and in the life of her larger environment. My edition included comments by the translator that I would recommend reading in advance of diving into ""The Years"", as it will allow you to connect with Ernaux's intelligent techniques from the beginning. Also, there are many references to historical events in France, all of which some readers may not be aware; however her struggles with who she is and what she is becoming, are universal and heart-felt in their sincerity. ""The Years"" is a flowing journey of events, both personal and historical, beautifully articulated by Ernaux.","Rochelle"
"19 - time through the silent lenses of this ‘she’. we view these years in a glorious birds eye view, its exterior motifs, we view the transformation of human life and in every page it begs us to put our own lives in this same perspective. an archive of time.

I found those sections harder to read, and later periods where history and memory became more globalized to be more familiar and thus resonant. That's not a flaw of the book itself--I'm not American enough to demand that the French author writing for a French audience write things that I understand, but it did detract from how much I might've enjoyed reading this.

In the end - it's a very pleasant and quick read with striking observations of a world we know, we think we know or we (claim to) remember, but eventually it didn't blow me away.","Sheline"

"""The future is too immense for her to imagine. It will happen, that's all.""
When I first started reading this book two years ago, I couldn't get through the first chapter. The way Ernaux captures snippets from the past was subtle, yet devastating. It felt like going through her memory box, a collection of newspaper clippings, songs, feelings, and photos blurring the lines between past and present. The bittersweetness of memory, the evanescence of youth, and how we spend our lives too quickly was too much for me at the time. I set the book aside.
Reading this book now makes me reflect on how I want to live but more importantly how I want to remember it, especially in a world where digital technologies dominate. Ernaux's own sentiment is that ""with digital technology, we drain reality dry"". How we save something from a time we will never be again is so closely tied to the medium that we capture that time with. Will I only remember my middle school days in the world of Instagram posts? Spotify playlists? What will I remember from my >100k photos stored, but unopened, sitting in my drive? In the fervor of capturing the perfect moment, taking hundreds of photos where the most important aspect is the taking of the photos, each photo's value is cheapened. What do we lose in this process? Will I truly be able to recall the feelings and sensations of the time that I have lived?
By finally finishing ""The Years"" for my 23rd bday, I gave myself the best bday gift I could ever ask for: an existential crisis.","momoka"
"Wonderful book. Very thrilling to read and to see the years go by, relived and remembered through artefacts or their illusions. We ping pong between memories and considerations on them, somewhere along what Ernaux remembers and what she can make of it.

EDIT: looking back on this there are (in my opinion) some beautiful reflections on memory and the passing of time similar to those drawn by Barthes in Camera Lucida. ""The Years"" really reads like a lovely combination of memories and how they shape/are shaped by us and remarkable story-telling. Highly recommended!","José"

"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.

I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"So good it almost made me like the Fr*nch","Olivia"
"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.

"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"

the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"

"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"

"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"
"Everyone go to your local bookshop/library and pick up an Annie Ernaux book, any Annie Ernaux book, and allow your life to be changed forever. The enormity of this memoir is heart-rending!","Andrea"
"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"

"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"

"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"
"It does precisely what the author wants it to do: ""By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.""","Jee Koh"
"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣

I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"

"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"
"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"
"Autobiographical novel with interesting POV (with which I had some big problems) is told in snippets, from postwar years till present time.

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.

"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.

"In her autobiography, ""The Years"", Annie Ernaux leads the reader down the 60 year path of her life. She uses historical events as the back drop to her story, touching on the chaos of political life in France, grappling with changes in French society, as well as accepting the ever-undulating phases in her life and that of her family, with calm and serenity. There are no chapters, but rather cleverly spaced paragraphs that indicate the continuation of commentary, the ends of thoughts, and the beginning of new years. Ernaux rebounds between pronouns, using ""she"", ""we"", ""one"", to personalize and also collectively describe events in her close life, and in the life of her larger environment. My edition included comments by the translator that I would recommend reading in advance of diving into ""The Years"", as it will allow you to connect with Ernaux's intelligent techniques from the beginning. Also, there are many references to historical events in France, all of which some readers may not be aware; however her struggles with who she is and what she is becoming, are universal and heart-felt in their sincerity. ""The Years"" is a flowing journey of events, both personal and historical, beautifully articulated by Ernaux.","Rochelle"

Reading this book now makes me reflect on how I want to live but more importantly how I want to remember it, especially in a world where digital technologies dominate.

"A lot of French references that went over my head but still a beautiful story abt life and womanhood","Darci Jones"
"This is a patchwork-book, between autobiography and nonfiction, telling the life of its author and of her generation in parallel. Some overarching themes were present throughout the book, a bridge between the author’s interests and the objective markers of her generation: feminism and the sexual liberation, capitalism and the société de consommation that ensued, the interest in world events and social causes, among other things.
As I was born in 1996, I came too late even for the latest events in the book: I remember the change of currency in 2002, from franc to euro, because we had to give the franc coins back, but that’s it. I didn’t live in that time, I have no nostalgy for it, but I liked that it helped me understand quite a lot about the current France.
Annie Ernaux talks a lot about the sexual liberation and the empowerment of women thanks to the pill and the abortion, as well as the right to *finally* talk about it. This right to talk about sex seems to have crystallized in an imperative: to show that you weren’t a prude, that you weren’t easily shocked, you had to use crude words. I know that my grandmother has never gotten over this particular powermove, and still loves using crude words and doing forbidden things (like breaking traffic laws at 80yo…). It always bothered me, but now I think it's partly a generational thing, the appeal of what was previously forbidden.
There’s also a lot on the subject of consumption, capitalism and globalization. The fascination with modern objects, the showing off, the difficulty to adapt for older people, etc. And on the subject of globalization, I was kind of shocked to realize that it was much easier for the previous generations to share the same cultural references. They read the same French authors and philosophers, liked the same French and American singers, watched the same TV channels and news reports, etc.
I wonder how integrated in this 20th century she really was: she only talks about 20th century, but is it caused by the constraints of the book (where she mostly shows the ways her life and her generation’s history intersect) or by a genuine appetite for newness at the time, that she also shared? She did say at some point that her generation thought 20th century books felt more appealing and worth reading than older classics. Was it an effect of the postwar era, this rejection of everything from before the war?
This mix of autobiography/nonfiction was particularly jarring for me. This focus on the 'generational' parts of her life means that she omitted her personal feelings towards friends and family members. The timeless human traits, unrelated to the big themes listed above, only appeared in passing. Which I thought made her seem distant and materialistic (who cares about frozen peas and product brands!), which she probably wasn’t. So it’s a distorted kind of autobiography! I knew it in a distant kind of way, but in practice I constantly forgot about it, and thought: okay, but how did she really feel about her ex-husband? and her new boyfriend, apart from the fact that he makes her feel younger?
And when she presents her generation as a united front on all the big themes listed above, she’s not trying for objectivity or inclusivity. Which is very obvious, but I wanted to read these ""we""-sentences as nonfiction, as universal truths of her generation. So she was talking about how ""we"" adulated Sartre and Simon de Beauvoir, and I thought, wait, that's not true, I know someone born in the 40's who can't stand them. Oh, right, not nonfiction either.
Unrelated to the autobiography/nonfiction genre-bending content, the prose was beautiful, épurée (""uncluttered"", but there must be a better translation?) and made me want to read more in French.","Joséphine"
"Really stunning, some of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read are contained in this novel. A unique way of storytelling, History (capital H) as a collective memory grounded in our individual experiences. Ernaux is searching for that lost time, or as she writes herself: ""To save something from the time where we will never be again.""
A story that begins in the shadow of World War II and ends with children playing the Nintendo Wii.
Truly to have grown up in this period of time is unique and exceptional in the Human experience - even from our arrogant posing in the 21st century with all our gadgets and received wisdom it cannot be denied how Historically, socially, individually exceptional a life between c. 1949-2008 would have been. (Part of this is how it feels like Time has become Flattened by the advent of social media, the digital world et al - can we really say we can differentiate between 2010 and 2019? Perhaps, actually, but I'm skeptical as of right now)
Stunning passages that are intimately familiar to myself (as a damned 'Gen Z') - globalisation, societal decay at the end of history, the dizzying effects of limitless consumption and digitalisation. ""We never stopped wanting to click on 'save' and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, a new social use of photos [...] What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded was we were living it [...] With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
The chunk of time spent on the late 50s through to the 60s-70s were, of course, my favourite passages. Vivid, loved, large, and most of all feeling ~important~. Figures that I have only ever seen in the past tense are living and breathing in this period - Camus, De Beauvoir, Barthes, Anna Karina, Godard - until they aren't, and they are mourned. Can you believe a million people walked behind Sartre's coffin?

"DNF at 100 pages
Surprised by how popular this book is considering it is so inaccessible to people who did not live in France. Too many references dropped in assuming the reader shares the same background made for hard reading.","Adna"
"Unreal. There isn’t anything I can imagine comparing it to- it seems to invent and subvert genre at the same time. Since Ernaux won the Nobel Prize, I’ve finally gotten around to reading her, having started with A Man’s Place and A Woman’s Story. To say this is a total departure in tone and style is an understatement- the terseness of those and other of her books is traded for a decadence of detail and sensation in The Years. It’s not a memoir, not a history- it’s something else. Totally compelling.","Brian"
"This book will probably be one of those that I will pick up again and again throughout the years. The sheer amount of passages that I highlighted speaks for itself (as you can see on the photo at the top of this post). From stylistically beautiful phrases, to clever observations or reflections on life as a woman that inspire to search for similar ones in one's own life. I think that depending on the age that you read this book at, different parts might speak to you more. I'd compare it to the phenomenon of the ""Sex and the City"" TV series, which you can watch an endless amount of times. Depending on the issues that you're going through in your life at that specific moment, you'd be noticing bits and pieces that you haven't paid attention to before, which I can see happening with this book as well.
My only issue with ""The Years"" was that it was too France-centric and it was impossible for me to fully get the meaning of all things referenced. Having started reading it in French, I quickly switched over to the English translation because I felt like I couldn't follow the storyline properly. It's only after diving into the translation that I realised that it was difficult to keep up with it in English as well. Cultural references like songs, singers, kids' rhymes, TV shows, movies, actors, as well as numerous historical events, both very big and very small, were mentioned, which I have never heard of before. I can see somebody French really enjoying this book more and it's the only reason why I personally decided to reduce one star from the final rating. Here an example of what many passages will read like:
the dashing figure of the actor Philippe Lemaire, married to Juliette Gréco [...]
of Elizabeth Drummond, murdered with her parents on a road in Lurs in 1952
p. 13
It became shameful to hope for revolution, and we didn't dare admit that we were saddened by Ulrike Meinhof's suicide in prison. Through some obscure reasoning, Althusser's crime of choking his wife to death in bed one Sunday morning was blamed as much on the Marxism he embodied as on any kind of mental problem.
p. 122
If you were to look up the details of each of those descriptions (which I was trying to do in the beginning), you would get a really detailed understanding of the French society and their collective memory. I couldn't stick to it throughout the whole book though, as it kept interrupting the reading flow. Nevertheless, imagining the author putting together the sheer amount and the details of these events, selecting the most significant ones for each year or each decade, was definitely impressive. The choice of the footnotes was therefore quite interesting, how some things were explained and others weren't. In my case I would have needed about four times more footnotes than the amount that was provided. Another specificity that I noticed since I compared the French original and the English translation throughout the first 30 pages, was how I ended up highlighting different passages in each language. I found some phrases more beautiful in French, whereas others spoke to me more in English. I'd therefore surely try reading the book completely in its original version at some point.
notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux du temps
p. 17 (French original)
Sitôt rentrés à la maison, on retrouvait sans y penser la langue originelle, qui n'obligeait pas à réfléchir aux mots, seulement aux choses à dire ou à ne pas dire, celle qui tenait au corps, liée aux paires de claques, à l'odeur d'eau de Javel des blouses, des pommes cuites tout l'hiver, aux bruits de pisse dans le seau et aux ronflements des parents.
p. 35 (French original)
The style the book was written in was definitely something that you would enjoy while reading. I even felt like reading some passages out loud because the rhythm of the words flowed so beautifully! The content was just as fascinating. Seeing the transition of society from the 1940s until 2006 through the shape of a collective memory, as well as influenced by the author's personal stories told in the third person, was definitely something that I haven't read in such a form before. From a society where hardly anyone traveled, hardly threw anything away, up until the current day times in the era of disposability, mobile phones, computers and all types of modern technology. It was really eye-opening, having the speed of how everything in our lives changed in a span of just about 70 years demonstrated in writing.
How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote.
p. 167-168
Nothing was thrown away. The contents of chamber pots were used for garden fertilizer, the dung of passing horses collected for potted plants. Newspaper was used for wrapping vegetables, drying shoes, wiping one's bottom in the lavatory.
p. 37
With digital technology, we drained reality dry.
p. 208
As much as there were parts that were very specific to the French society, there were just as many passages that universally applied. What it means to transition from being a girl, to a teenager, to a woman, the problems you face on the way, the reflections you might have and the transformations that you would go through as a person. All these found expression in ""The Years"" as well. The general idea of the book reminded me of Deborah Levy's autobiography trilogy, consisting of three books: ""Things I Don't Want to Know"" , ""The Cost of Living"" and ""Real Estate"" . Both women speak about what it means to be a writer, the discovery of one's own identity in solitude, going through divorce and life after it, as well as having children and seeing them grow up.
Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write 'a kind of woman's destiny', set between 1940 and 1985. It would be [...] a 'total novel' that would end with her dispossession of people and things: parents and husband, children who leave home, furniture that is sold.
p. 148
When she can't sleep at night, she tries to remember the details of all the rooms where she has slept: the one she shared with her parents until the age of thirteen, the ones at the university residence and the Annecy apartment facing the cemetery.
p. 166
I was extremely glad to have discovered the book and the author for the first time thanks to the ""Barcelona Women's Book Club"" . I felt like it would be an especially impactful read for women but even taken generally, it was an exceptional piece of writing. I would highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to reading further books by Annie Ernaux.
More reviews on my blog - KHVBooks.com","Veronika"
"Save something from the time where we will never be again. This was the final quote and I think the ultimate message of the book. I enjoyed reading it, the author's writing style is truly remarkable. The book had plenty very detailed references to French sociopolitical events of 21st century that an average non French reader would not know but that did not prevent me from enjoying every bit of it.","Arpi"
"We joked, “God is dead, Marx is dead, and I don’t feel so good either.” We had a sense of play.
Play is a good term. Ernaux is playing with memory. It is her story. She was born in France during the Second World War, as she recalls the hardships on her family, the rebuilding of the country and their zeal to forget what happened. She grows up, goes to college, becomes a teacher, talks about sex and abortion (told in another book), gets married, has children, gets disallusioned with marriage, it ends, starts life anew, has an affair with a younger man (another book too), retires and reflects on her life, her country and history. Sixty-five years.
It is also look back at the latter half of the twentieth century. It’s our collective history. May 1968, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 911 are landmarks. She covers themes like politics, sexual politics, war (there are a lot of them and how quickly we forget), and global events. Terrorism, racism, immigration, feminism, and religion. It reflects on how technology has changed us, slowly at first then it’s everywhere. It is a tale of us.
She speaks to us in third person and never singles herself out. It’s not really an autobiography but rather a recalling of life and events of this time. Her story is triggered by Ernaux looking at old photographs, Super 8 movies and videos. That is her play.
Buried in the book is the spark to write this book. What is the “Madeline” that trigger her to write this Proustian tale? Just as Proust reflected on his life, times, loves and events, Ernaux does the same (in much less pages).
It’s her life and our life all wrapped into one continuous story. Impersonal and yet oddly personal. Indelibly odd, beautiful and at times funny. How does our memory work on the past? Are these accurate and does it matter?
So many these events I could relate to which made me realize the common thread that binds us together. She is French and twenty years older than myself but her words triggered my own memories. Perhaps we humans are not as different as we think we are? What binds us together is more than what separates us.
Now I understand why she used the word “we” to describe her life. We really can’t separate ourselves from the world. Our world. Our past. The years.","David"
"Last year I had not heard of Annie Ernaux. Then I began to manage a new bookshop and we got in a range of books from independent publishers. I noticed that Fitzcarraldo seemed to be especially good and have a very high reputation. I had never read any of their books, despite having Second Hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich on my book shelves for years (I still haven't read it yet). Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk is one of our bestselling books, so I read that to see what the fuss was all about, and thought it was great. We were asked to host an event with Joshua Cohen for his book The Netenyahus, so we did, and I thought that novel was great, and it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize the next year. Then they asked if we would host an event for Daisy Hildyard for Emergency, so we did, and I thought it was another excellent novel. But we have more books by Annie Ernaux from Fitzcarraldo then any other writer, and she seems to have a fanbase that consists mostly of intelligent young women, so I picked up The Years a couple of months ago. Just as I decided it was time to read it Ernaux won the Nobel Prize.
This is the best Fitzcarraldo book I have read yet, and I think it's one of the best books of the 21st Century so far. It is a marvellous book, blending together autobiography, history and sociology in a very literary style. Ernaux reveals and crafts the sweep of her life, from being born into a relatively poor provincial family during WW2, through the social, political and material transformations that took place in French society in the decades that follow as she experiences the youth rebellion of the 50' and 60's, ascends into the bourgeoise, becomes a teacher, a wife and mother, experiences the revolutionary moment of May 68, and the political disappointment and cynicism that follows in the subsequent decades.
I cannot do the book justice with this description. I think it is one of the essential books of the 21st century. I can't think of a British writer operating at this level. And we should be very thankful to Fitzcarraldo for bringing the best literature in the world into being, and into English.","Darran Mclaughlin"
"Superb and highly original.
Besides being a pretty marvellous meditation on ageing and memory, this is such a simple (ha) and utterly sensible idea. Namely, that you are a product of your time, so what better way to write about a life than to retell it, overwhelmingly (but not exclusively), through the events and conventions of the age you lived through. It's so obvious that I can't believe it isn't seen more in fiction. And yes, that question: is it fiction (yes, surely). I love it how French lit keeps pushing the boundaries like this.
It's all rather moving and it's hard not to feel quite powerful empathy for the subject (I'd compare it a bit to 'The Up Series'). I for one found myself - dare I say it - feeling greater understanding of the Boomer generation (though actually these guys are older - they're more like Wartime Generation,,,though they were young in '68 too) and the cultural turns they experienced. By which I mean: growing up in a world where you had to get married to have sex and wearing lipstick was seen as whore-like...to letting your offspring have their their girlfriend stay over. No wonder they were a bit confused and contorted.
As the years a pass, ones own memories come into view...which, in a way, adds to the interest.
I'm not sure if this is Annie Ernaux's 'method', but it's very readable and makes for a kind of literary documentary. A sort of : this is what we were like. The only example in English of that voice I can remember is 'And Then We Came to the End' dealing in an entirely different realm. It works extremely well. As an observer of Francophonie and France in a permanent state of trying to catch up and fill in gaps, it's almost prefect reading for me. I hope the English version does well.
Oh by the way: the name of the pub in Finchley is the 'Tally Ho Corner'. I had to Google 'Telly O'Corner' to check if this was something she'd dreamed. It's a sweet example of bad-memory Chinese Whispers. Bravo.","Jake Goretzki"
"We are reading Annie Ernaux and we are very delighted. 'The Year's' promises an authorship that will enjoy us with more books with similar high class. We think it must be their best choice since Jose Saramago, in purely egoistic terms. We like it, that we understand, become engaged, enjoyed and feel as a part of even the literary world.
We sometimes have felt all stupid again, from choices we couldn't even understand. We felt it was too prudish at times. An ill smelling snobbery pricing literature for a tiny group of writers with a symbolism of no general availability for other cultures. We felt ashamed when Sweden, again, was priced. We felt cheated when our favourites never got it. They hate predictability, which is something we still, also, like about them. We don't like when they make statements though. Giving a brilliant singer, writing good local journalism this price we realise they are being unaware of biases and the effects on music to dope lyrics with qualities of moment. You don't have to keep the words moving with thinking, since music makes them seem alive in a not very magical way.
But only a week with the francophile choice of Annie Ernaux we are already very delighted. We got ourselves an author not unknown to focus on. We think of Ali Smith reading and are filled with joy, although it's less general (arguably), and packed with references only referring to France. We long to read another book by her, while still reading the first one. We don't forgive this noble institution but we know that people in power through all ages have tremendous collective disabilities in mentalisation. We are ourselves expressing views on topics without that much knowledge on them, or how they will be understood by others. And we are only one.","Anders Demitz-Helin"
"The Years is a slender book, but feels epic, spanning 70-years during the author's coming of age and life in France. While I can't deny that many of the major political events, figures, and movements felt foreign to me as an American, what makes The Years absorbing and unique is they way Ernaux captures a nation's feelings and experiences in relation to significant historic events, and renders them as universal. Through an inventive and original form of ""collective autobiography"" she presents, as she puts it, “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” It's a style that immediately sucks you in and makes you feel like an empathetic participant, even if you're an outsider.
For such an intellectual work, The Years could have been stuffy and impenetrable, but instead finds the right balance between niche, European, auto-fic and accessible, mainstream memoir. This is a book in which you can find the author's thoughts on French society, history, and politics bumping up against modern cultural touch-points like H&M shopping, mobile phones, the early internet, and Playstation. Add to that Ernaux's stunning prose and perceptive observations, and you have one of the smartest and most captivating non-fiction works of the year.
It's tough to pick a favorite passage, but one for me of many:
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""","Joe M"
"This book really grew on me as the narrative unfolded. The intertwining of personal and collective experience becomes more and more compelling. It is like an intimate memoir written by an entire generation. It is both touching and thought provoking.","Helen"
"Annie's diary covering the years from 1940 to 2006; roughly my peer. Although she talks about growing up and living in France, there are enough parallels between her life and mine as as American female as she watches and analyzes the decades morph and change. The world has changed dramatically from WWII until now, so I can relate to her observations.
“She often revisits images of herself single, in the streets of the cities where she has walked and in the rooms that she has occupied – in a young ladies’ hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair, or in a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The object of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: ‘Out of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not’”… pg 94
“She has lost her sense of the future, a kind of limitless background on which her actions and gestures were once projected, a waiting for all the good and unknown things that lived inside her…” pg 227","Candice"
"I read this novel right before Annie Ernaux was awarded with the Noble Prize, starting it for the second time, after having giving up a first time. Sadly, this novel was not for me. While this autobiography is very cleverly structured, it baffles me to see all the five-star reviews, as I think the text would only need interesting to the French.
To me, the whole book felt like a drawn-out conversation with a bourgeois Frenchman who wants to show how humanitarian he or she is and how everything he or she does is, in fact, done in solidarity with lower-class people. Showing solidarity is obviously not the problem, but rather the fact that this kind of people emphasize it so much, as if they want to get a medal for it.
Stylistically, I initially liked the vignettes about photographs Ernaux describes, but I quickly got tired of the fact that she simply swaps out ""je"" for ""nous"" to make her experiences universal. The meta chapter at the end (about writing this novel) was downright cheesy.","Lotte"
"I dnfed this book because although this was said to be translated, yet it still has a language barrier that I couldn't understand. To keep looking it up every few minutes was getting frustrating. I also did not like the way that this autobiography was written in individual sentence form or in very short paragraph form, it was confusing.
Sexual desire was compared to memories in the same breath as talking about grandparents and parents...bizarre. Things didn't seem to mesh well together or tie in well most of the time.
Some things that the author stated I didn't even understand such as , "" To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.""Huh?
Again, not sure if it a language barrier thing or the way it was written but I only made it a couple chapters before giving up. This is very rare for me , as you can see this is only my second dnf book out of almost 400. I did give this book to a friend, though, here's hoping that she enjoys it more!","Michelle"
"For a book that is pretty much an endless list of summarized French (and occasionally World) history, this just feels so empty. It’s sprawling time-wise for a memoir, but doesn’t go deep into anything mentioned. It’s basically a timeline of a woman’s life from 1941-2006 punctuated by both historical events and random life shit specific to Ernaux.
The parts about growing up as a French girl of her socio-economic status in the 40s-50s, and then experiencing the country transition to a more equal place for women had me interested. If this had a consistent feminist lens I imagine I would have enjoyed it more, but it really seems to lose its focus in the second 1/2, last 1/3rd especially, and seems to get more disjointed.
I’m sorry but I’d rather just read a history book and get a complete picture. To me, writing a book centered on memory and the passage of time is a worn-out concept. At least it’s a woman that’s doing it this time.
Also I don’t like her prose style.","Amelia"
"The Years by Annie Ernaux – it spans from Ernaux’s birth in 1940 to 2006. It is not a biography in a traditional sense as it is told as ‘we’ but Ernaux tells both her story and that of her generation. The book felt like a chronicle, record of facts, but I could feel Ernaux’s passion, somewhat disguised but yet coming through. I absolutely loved her references to writers, artists, politicians and I took note of many to learn more about them. Her language can feel raw at times and I like that too. That book is a keeper for me, I have it in Polish beautifully published by Czarne.

"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Memory, Time, Education Writing.
The four things that stood out to me very much in Annie Ernaux’s The Years— the winner of the Nobel prize in literature this year, 2022.
I picked this short book very randomly— I was bored with my other current reads and the Nobel prize was just announced around this time. Of a curiosity about why Annie Ernaux was chosen as the laureate, I picked up the book and am glad to say that now, I know why she won.
The Years was a beautiful, breathless piece of writing about time—-about Annie Ernaux but not limited to her own self. Honestly, it's much more fitting that this is an autobiography of a generation.
Taling or instead reminiscing the things that happened from the 1940s to 2007.
There is something nostalgic in Annie Ernaux’s way of laying moments in her life down in the book. I am not a french person yet reading what the french kids did way back in her childhood still gave me this feeling of nostalgia.
It's also fascinating to see the passage of time here— the narrator growing up from being a kid to a woman in her sixties. The historical event she experienced reminisced— all the wars, all the revolutions, the turn of the century; the feeling of transitioning from 1900 to 2000 and how underwhelming it is—it was like watching a life taking shape.
Annie Ernaux’s Prose too pioneered the greatness of the book. The content was already great, but Ernaux’s way of writing with such rawness and intimacy, and beauty elevated everything to heaven.
Aside from memory and time, Ernaux also wrote about her desire to write and what is education for her. The desire to study and write makes you want to change the world and cement yourself in history, which I could relate to heavily.
And there are also moments so raw that it felt invasive to read. It felt like I have read something from a diary that I was not supposed to see yet it captivated me because of its immense beauty and intimacy, which made me just emotional from reading it.
Quotes that resonated with me very much;
about memory:
Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual difference and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation
about mother:
When it comes to her mother, she remembers the eyes, the hands, the silhouette; the voice, only in the abstract, without texture. The real voice is lost; she has no concrete remnant of it. But phrases often rise to her lips spontaneously, the same ones her mother used in the same contexts, expressions she didn’t remember ever using herself, “The weather is sluggish,” “He talked my ear off,” “You have to wait your turn, like at confession,” etc. It was if her mother were speaking through her mouth, and with her an entire lineage. Other phrases come into her head sometimes, the ones her mother used after she got Alzheimer’s. Their incongruity revealed her mother’s altered mental state, “You can bring me some rags to wipe my bottom with.” In a flash, her mother’s body and presence are returned to her. Unlike the former sentences, repeatedly used, the latter are unique, forever the preserve of one sole being in the world, her mother.
about Writing:
To see her in the photo, a handsome solid girl, one would never suspect that more than anything, she fears going mad. Only writing—or perhaps a man—can protect her from that, if only momentarily. She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
About education:
It seems to her that education is more than just a way to escape poverty. It is a weapon of choice against stagnation in a kind of feminine condition that arouses her pity, the tendency to lose oneself in a man, which she has experienced (see the high school photo from five years before) and of which she is ashamed. She feels no desire to marry or have children. Mothering and the life of the mind seem incompatible. In any case, she’d be sure to be a bad mother. Her ideal is the union libre in the poem by André Breton. At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels “hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories,” that she is “looking for another language” and “longs to return to an original purity.” She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are “little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night.” Other sentences contradict this lassitude: “I am a will and a desire.” She does not say for what.
About aging:
She feels no age difference with women of forty-five or fifty, an illusion which the latter destroy in the course of conversation, without malice but implying that she doesn’t belong to the same generation as they, and is seen by them in the way she herself sees a woman of eighty, i.e., old. Unlike adolescence, when she was sure of not being the same from one year or even one month to the next, now she feels immutable in a world that moves ahead in leaps and bounds.","Ben Martizz"
"I can see why this book won a Nobel Prize. It captures the life of an unnamed woman from childhood to old age. It is done in a very readable way. I really enjoyed it.","Brie"
"Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it’s slipping by, but at the same time “progress” has landed us in a place we no longer recognize.
New York Times
I appreciated the history lesson and the honesty in this memoir. Many such essay collections become a laundry list of complaints but this memoir was diverse in topic and nuanced in explanation. It is a cruel irony that the bottle sitting by the sink that bleaches your hair to the shade of blond you wanted so badly is brought to you by the same corporations that you complain about pushing the latest toasters.","cycads and ferns"
"We had such a nice discussion of this memoir in our book club. I kind of let the details wash over me and didn't worry about things that were too French for me to understand. I appreciated the events she chose to highlight and the ones she left out (for example, an American memoirist of her era would certainly have addressed the Civil Rights Movement while I had to do some light research on Algeria which is clearly more important in France). Once we moved into events in my lifetime, I was even more engaged.","Andrea"
"All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.

"This book depicts and relies heavily on cultural and social references from its author’s French background, which often makes it indecipherable to the reader that is not familiar with this context. This was very frustrating, as these references are just too many and make the backbone of the whole narrative. Otherwise, some parts are beautifully written.","Ana de Oliveira Casella"
"this honestly took me a while to get into due to the writing style (i got this book at the beginning of the year) but now that i’ve finished it, i am in complete awe.

"Just unbelievable, one of those books that feels like it is ready to be a classic in the next couple of decades, and cements Ernaux as one of my favourite writers ever","Oliver Shrouder"
"This is a patchwork-book, between autobiography and nonfiction, telling the life of its author and of her generation in parallel. Some overarching themes were present throughout the book, a bridge between the author’s interests and the objective markers of her generation: feminism and the sexual liberation, capitalism and the société de consommation that ensued, the interest in world events and social causes, among other things.
As I was born in 1996, I came too late even for the latest events in the book: I remember the change of currency in 2002, from franc to euro, because we had to give the franc coins back, but that’s it. I didn’t live in that time, I have no nostalgy for it, but I liked that it helped me understand quite a lot about the current France.
Annie Ernaux talks a lot about the sexual liberation and the empowerment of women thanks to the pill and the abortion, as well as the right to *finally* talk about it. This right to talk about sex seems to have crystallized in an imperative: to show that you weren’t a prude, that you weren’t easily shocked, you had to use crude words. I know that my grandmother has never gotten over this particular powermove, and still loves using crude words and doing forbidden things (like breaking traffic laws at 80yo…). It always bothered me, but now I think it's partly a generational thing, the appeal of what was previously forbidden.
There’s also a lot on the subject of consumption, capitalism and globalization. The fascination with modern objects, the showing off, the difficulty to adapt for older people, etc. And on the subject of globalization, I was kind of shocked to realize that it was much easier for the previous generations to share the same cultural references. They read the same French authors and philosophers, liked the same French and American singers, watched the same TV channels and news reports, etc.
I wonder how integrated in this 20th century she really was: she only talks about 20th century, but is it caused by the constraints of the book (where she mostly shows the ways her life and her generation’s history intersect) or by a genuine appetite for newness at the time, that she also shared? She did say at some point that her generation thought 20th century books felt more appealing and worth reading than older classics. Was it an effect of the postwar era, this rejection of everything from before the war?
This mix of autobiography/nonfiction was particularly jarring for me. This focus on the 'generational' parts of her life means that she omitted her personal feelings towards friends and family members. The timeless human traits, unrelated to the big themes listed above, only appeared in passing. Which I thought made her seem distant and materialistic (who cares about frozen peas and product brands!), which she probably wasn’t. So it’s a distorted kind of autobiography! I knew it in a distant kind of way, but in practice I constantly forgot about it, and thought: okay, but how did she really feel about her ex-husband? and her new boyfriend, apart from the fact that he makes her feel younger?
And when she presents her generation as a united front on all the big themes listed above, she’s not trying for objectivity or inclusivity. Which is very obvious, but I wanted to read these ""we""-sentences as nonfiction, as universal truths of her generation. So she was talking about how ""we"" adulated Sartre and Simon de Beauvoir, and I thought, wait, that's not true, I know someone born in the 40's who can't stand them. Oh, right, not nonfiction either.
Unrelated to the autobiography/nonfiction genre-bending content, the prose was beautiful, épurée (""uncluttered"", but there must be a better translation?) and made me want to read more in French.","Joséphine"
"Really stunning, some of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read are contained in this novel. A unique way of storytelling, History (capital H) as a collective memory grounded in our individual experiences. Ernaux is searching for that lost time, or as she writes herself: ""To save something from the time where we will never be again.""
A story that begins in the shadow of World War II and ends with children playing the Nintendo Wii.
Truly to have grown up in this period of time is unique and exceptional in the Human experience - even from our arrogant posing in the 21st century with all our gadgets and received wisdom it cannot be denied how Historically, socially, individually exceptional a life between c. 1949-2008 would have been. (Part of this is how it feels like Time has become Flattened by the advent of social media, the digital world et al - can we really say we can differentiate between 2010 and 2019? Perhaps, actually, but I'm skeptical as of right now)
Stunning passages that are intimately familiar to myself (as a damned 'Gen Z') - globalisation, societal decay at the end of history, the dizzying effects of limitless consumption and digitalisation. ""We never stopped wanting to click on 'save' and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, a new social use of photos [...] What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded was we were living it [...] With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
The chunk of time spent on the late 50s through to the 60s-70s were, of course, my favourite passages. Vivid, loved, large, and most of all feeling ~important~. Figures that I have only ever seen in the past tense are living and breathing in this period - Camus, De Beauvoir, Barthes, Anna Karina, Godard - until they aren't, and they are mourned. Can you believe a million people walked behind Sartre's coffin?

Surprised by how popular this book is considering it is so inaccessible to people who did not live in France. Too many references dropped in assuming the reader shares the same background made for hard reading.","Adna"
"Unreal. There isn’t anything I can imagine comparing it to- it seems to invent and subvert genre at the same time. Since Ernaux won the Nobel Prize, I’ve finally gotten around to reading her, having started with A Man’s Place and A Woman’s Story. To say this is a total departure in tone and style is an understatement- the terseness of those and other of her books is traded for a decadence of detail and sensation in The Years. It’s not a memoir, not a history- it’s something else. Totally compelling.","Brian"
"This book will probably be one of those that I will pick up again and again throughout the years. The sheer amount of passages that I highlighted speaks for itself (as you can see on the photo at the top of this post). From stylistically beautiful phrases, to clever observations or reflections on life as a woman that inspire to search for similar ones in one's own life. I think that depending on the age that you read this book at, different parts might speak to you more. I'd compare it to the phenomenon of the ""Sex and the City"" TV series, which you can watch an endless amount of times. Depending on the issues that you're going through in your life at that specific moment, you'd be noticing bits and pieces that you haven't paid attention to before, which I can see happening with this book as well.
My only issue with ""The Years"" was that it was too France-centric and it was impossible for me to fully get the meaning of all things referenced. Having started reading it in French, I quickly switched over to the English translation because I felt like I couldn't follow the storyline properly. It's only after diving into the translation that I realised that it was difficult to keep up with it in English as well. Cultural references like songs, singers, kids' rhymes, TV shows, movies, actors, as well as numerous historical events, both very big and very small, were mentioned, which I have never heard of before. I can see somebody French really enjoying this book more and it's the only reason why I personally decided to reduce one star from the final rating. Here an example of what many passages will read like:
the dashing figure of the actor Philippe Lemaire, married to Juliette Gréco [...]
of Elizabeth Drummond, murdered with her parents on a road in Lurs in 1952
p. 13
It became shameful to hope for revolution, and we didn't dare admit that we were saddened by Ulrike Meinhof's suicide in prison. Through some obscure reasoning, Althusser's crime of choking his wife to death in bed one Sunday morning was blamed as much on the Marxism he embodied as on any kind of mental problem.
p. 122
If you were to look up the details of each of those descriptions (which I was trying to do in the beginning), you would get a really detailed understanding of the French society and their collective memory. I couldn't stick to it throughout the whole book though, as it kept interrupting the reading flow. Nevertheless, imagining the author putting together the sheer amount and the details of these events, selecting the most significant ones for each year or each decade, was definitely impressive. The choice of the footnotes was therefore quite interesting, how some things were explained and others weren't. In my case I would have needed about four times more footnotes than the amount that was provided. Another specificity that I noticed since I compared the French original and the English translation throughout the first 30 pages, was how I ended up highlighting different passages in each language. I found some phrases more beautiful in French, whereas others spoke to me more in English. I'd therefore surely try reading the book completely in its original version at some point.
notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux du temps
p. 17 (French original)
Sitôt rentrés à la maison, on retrouvait sans y penser la langue originelle, qui n'obligeait pas à réfléchir aux mots, seulement aux choses à dire ou à ne pas dire, celle qui tenait au corps, liée aux paires de claques, à l'odeur d'eau de Javel des blouses, des pommes cuites tout l'hiver, aux bruits de pisse dans le seau et aux ronflements des parents.
p. 35 (French original)
The style the book was written in was definitely something that you would enjoy while reading. I even felt like reading some passages out loud because the rhythm of the words flowed so beautifully! The content was just as fascinating. Seeing the transition of society from the 1940s until 2006 through the shape of a collective memory, as well as influenced by the author's personal stories told in the third person, was definitely something that I haven't read in such a form before. From a society where hardly anyone traveled, hardly threw anything away, up until the current day times in the era of disposability, mobile phones, computers and all types of modern technology. It was really eye-opening, having the speed of how everything in our lives changed in a span of just about 70 years demonstrated in writing.
How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote.
p. 167-168
Nothing was thrown away. The contents of chamber pots were used for garden fertilizer, the dung of passing horses collected for potted plants. Newspaper was used for wrapping vegetables, drying shoes, wiping one's bottom in the lavatory.
p. 37
With digital technology, we drained reality dry.
p. 208
As much as there were parts that were very specific to the French society, there were just as many passages that universally applied. What it means to transition from being a girl, to a teenager, to a woman, the problems you face on the way, the reflections you might have and the transformations that you would go through as a person. All these found expression in ""The Years"" as well. The general idea of the book reminded me of Deborah Levy's autobiography trilogy, consisting of three books: ""Things I Don't Want to Know"" , ""The Cost of Living"" and ""Real Estate"" . Both women speak about what it means to be a writer, the discovery of one's own identity in solitude, going through divorce and life after it, as well as having children and seeing them grow up.
Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write 'a kind of woman's destiny', set between 1940 and 1985. It would be [...] a 'total novel' that would end with her dispossession of people and things: parents and husband, children who leave home, furniture that is sold.
p. 148
When she can't sleep at night, she tries to remember the details of all the rooms where she has slept: the one she shared with her parents until the age of thirteen, the ones at the university residence and the Annecy apartment facing the cemetery.
p. 166
I was extremely glad to have discovered the book and the author for the first time thanks to the ""Barcelona Women's Book Club"" . I felt like it would be an especially impactful read for women but even taken generally, it was an exceptional piece of writing. I would highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to reading further books by Annie Ernaux.

"Save something from the time where we will never be again. This was the final quote and I think the ultimate message of the book. I enjoyed reading it, the author's writing style is truly remarkable. The book had plenty very detailed references to French sociopolitical events of 21st century that an average non French reader would not know but that did not prevent me from enjoying every bit of it.","Arpi"
"We joked, “God is dead, Marx is dead, and I don’t feel so good either.” We had a sense of play.
Play is a good term. Ernaux is playing with memory. It is her story. She was born in France during the Second World War, as she recalls the hardships on her family, the rebuilding of the country and their zeal to forget what happened. She grows up, goes to college, becomes a teacher, talks about sex and abortion (told in another book), gets married, has children, gets disallusioned with marriage, it ends, starts life anew, has an affair with a younger man (another book too), retires and reflects on her life, her country and history. Sixty-five years.
It is also look back at the latter half of the twentieth century. It’s our collective history. May 1968, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 911 are landmarks. She covers themes like politics, sexual politics, war (there are a lot of them and how quickly we forget), and global events. Terrorism, racism, immigration, feminism, and religion. It reflects on how technology has changed us, slowly at first then it’s everywhere. It is a tale of us.
She speaks to us in third person and never singles herself out. It’s not really an autobiography but rather a recalling of life and events of this time. Her story is triggered by Ernaux looking at old photographs, Super 8 movies and videos. That is her play.
Buried in the book is the spark to write this book. What is the “Madeline” that trigger her to write this Proustian tale? Just as Proust reflected on his life, times, loves and events, Ernaux does the same (in much less pages).
It’s her life and our life all wrapped into one continuous story. Impersonal and yet oddly personal. Indelibly odd, beautiful and at times funny. How does our memory work on the past? Are these accurate and does it matter?
So many these events I could relate to which made me realize the common thread that binds us together. She is French and twenty years older than myself but her words triggered my own memories. Perhaps we humans are not as different as we think we are? What binds us together is more than what separates us.
Now I understand why she used the word “we” to describe her life. We really can’t separate ourselves from the world. Our world. Our past. The years.","David"
"Last year I had not heard of Annie Ernaux. Then I began to manage a new bookshop and we got in a range of books from independent publishers. I noticed that Fitzcarraldo seemed to be especially good and have a very high reputation. I had never read any of their books, despite having Second Hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich on my book shelves for years (I still haven't read it yet). Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk is one of our bestselling books, so I read that to see what the fuss was all about, and thought it was great. We were asked to host an event with Joshua Cohen for his book The Netenyahus, so we did, and I thought that novel was great, and it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize the next year. Then they asked if we would host an event for Daisy Hildyard for Emergency, so we did, and I thought it was another excellent novel. But we have more books by Annie Ernaux from Fitzcarraldo then any other writer, and she seems to have a fanbase that consists mostly of intelligent young women, so I picked up The Years a couple of months ago. Just as I decided it was time to read it Ernaux won the Nobel Prize.
This is the best Fitzcarraldo book I have read yet, and I think it's one of the best books of the 21st Century so far. It is a marvellous book, blending together autobiography, history and sociology in a very literary style. Ernaux reveals and crafts the sweep of her life, from being born into a relatively poor provincial family during WW2, through the social, political and material transformations that took place in French society in the decades that follow as she experiences the youth rebellion of the 50' and 60's, ascends into the bourgeoise, becomes a teacher, a wife and mother, experiences the revolutionary moment of May 68, and the political disappointment and cynicism that follows in the subsequent decades.
I cannot do the book justice with this description. I think it is one of the essential books of the 21st century. I can't think of a British writer operating at this level. And we should be very thankful to Fitzcarraldo for bringing the best literature in the world into being, and into English.","Darran Mclaughlin"
"Superb and highly original.
Besides being a pretty marvellous meditation on ageing and memory, this is such a simple (ha) and utterly sensible idea. Namely, that you are a product of your time, so what better way to write about a life than to retell it, overwhelmingly (but not exclusively), through the events and conventions of the age you lived through. It's so obvious that I can't believe it isn't seen more in fiction. And yes, that question: is it fiction (yes, surely). I love it how French lit keeps pushing the boundaries like this.
It's all rather moving and it's hard not to feel quite powerful empathy for the subject (I'd compare it a bit to 'The Up Series'). I for one found myself - dare I say it - feeling greater understanding of the Boomer generation (though actually these guys are older - they're more like Wartime Generation,,,though they were young in '68 too) and the cultural turns they experienced. By which I mean: growing up in a world where you had to get married to have sex and wearing lipstick was seen as whore-like...to letting your offspring have their their girlfriend stay over. No wonder they were a bit confused and contorted.
As the years a pass, ones own memories come into view...which, in a way, adds to the interest.
I'm not sure if this is Annie Ernaux's 'method', but it's very readable and makes for a kind of literary documentary. A sort of : this is what we were like. The only example in English of that voice I can remember is 'And Then We Came to the End' dealing in an entirely different realm. It works extremely well. As an observer of Francophonie and France in a permanent state of trying to catch up and fill in gaps, it's almost prefect reading for me. I hope the English version does well.
Oh by the way: the name of the pub in Finchley is the 'Tally Ho Corner'. I had to Google 'Telly O'Corner' to check if this was something she'd dreamed. It's a sweet example of bad-memory Chinese Whispers. Bravo.","Jake Goretzki"
"We are reading Annie Ernaux and we are very delighted. 'The Year's' promises an authorship that will enjoy us with more books with similar high class. We think it must be their best choice since Jose Saramago, in purely egoistic terms. We like it, that we understand, become engaged, enjoyed and feel as a part of even the literary world.
We sometimes have felt all stupid again, from choices we couldn't even understand. We felt it was too prudish at times. An ill smelling snobbery pricing literature for a tiny group of writers with a symbolism of no general availability for other cultures. We felt ashamed when Sweden, again, was priced. We felt cheated when our favourites never got it. They hate predictability, which is something we still, also, like about them. We don't like when they make statements though. Giving a brilliant singer, writing good local journalism this price we realise they are being unaware of biases and the effects on music to dope lyrics with qualities of moment. You don't have to keep the words moving with thinking, since music makes them seem alive in a not very magical way.
But only a week with the francophile choice of Annie Ernaux we are already very delighted. We got ourselves an author not unknown to focus on. We think of Ali Smith reading and are filled with joy, although it's less general (arguably), and packed with references only referring to France. We long to read another book by her, while still reading the first one. We don't forgive this noble institution but we know that people in power through all ages have tremendous collective disabilities in mentalisation. We are ourselves expressing views on topics without that much knowledge on them, or how they will be understood by others. And we are only one.","Anders Demitz-Helin"
"The Years is a slender book, but feels epic, spanning 70-years during the author's coming of age and life in France. While I can't deny that many of the major political events, figures, and movements felt foreign to me as an American, what makes The Years absorbing and unique is they way Ernaux captures a nation's feelings and experiences in relation to significant historic events, and renders them as universal. Through an inventive and original form of ""collective autobiography"" she presents, as she puts it, “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” It's a style that immediately sucks you in and makes you feel like an empathetic participant, even if you're an outsider.
For such an intellectual work, The Years could have been stuffy and impenetrable, but instead finds the right balance between niche, European, auto-fic and accessible, mainstream memoir. This is a book in which you can find the author's thoughts on French society, history, and politics bumping up against modern cultural touch-points like H&M shopping, mobile phones, the early internet, and Playstation. Add to that Ernaux's stunning prose and perceptive observations, and you have one of the smartest and most captivating non-fiction works of the year.
It's tough to pick a favorite passage, but one for me of many:
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""","Joe M"
"This book really grew on me as the narrative unfolded. The intertwining of personal and collective experience becomes more and more compelling. It is like an intimate memoir written by an entire generation. It is both touching and thought provoking.","Helen"
"Annie's diary covering the years from 1940 to 2006; roughly my peer. Although she talks about growing up and living in France, there are enough parallels between her life and mine as as American female as she watches and analyzes the decades morph and change. The world has changed dramatically from WWII until now, so I can relate to her observations.
“She often revisits images of herself single, in the streets of the cities where she has walked and in the rooms that she has occupied – in a young ladies’ hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair, or in a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The object of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: ‘Out of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not’”… pg 94
“She has lost her sense of the future, a kind of limitless background on which her actions and gestures were once projected, a waiting for all the good and unknown things that lived inside her…” pg 227","Candice"
"I read this novel right before Annie Ernaux was awarded with the Noble Prize, starting it for the second time, after having giving up a first time. Sadly, this novel was not for me. While this autobiography is very cleverly structured, it baffles me to see all the five-star reviews, as I think the text would only need interesting to the French.
To me, the whole book felt like a drawn-out conversation with a bourgeois Frenchman who wants to show how humanitarian he or she is and how everything he or she does is, in fact, done in solidarity with lower-class people. Showing solidarity is obviously not the problem, but rather the fact that this kind of people emphasize it so much, as if they want to get a medal for it.
Stylistically, I initially liked the vignettes about photographs Ernaux describes, but I quickly got tired of the fact that she simply swaps out ""je"" for ""nous"" to make her experiences universal. The meta chapter at the end (about writing this novel) was downright cheesy.","Lotte"
"I dnfed this book because although this was said to be translated, yet it still has a language barrier that I couldn't understand. To keep looking it up every few minutes was getting frustrating. I also did not like the way that this autobiography was written in individual sentence form or in very short paragraph form, it was confusing.
Sexual desire was compared to memories in the same breath as talking about grandparents and parents...bizarre. Things didn't seem to mesh well together or tie in well most of the time.
Some things that the author stated I didn't even understand such as , "" To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.""Huh?
Again, not sure if it a language barrier thing or the way it was written but I only made it a couple chapters before giving up. This is very rare for me , as you can see this is only my second dnf book out of almost 400. I did give this book to a friend, though, here's hoping that she enjoys it more!","Michelle"
"For a book that is pretty much an endless list of summarized French (and occasionally World) history, this just feels so empty. It’s sprawling time-wise for a memoir, but doesn’t go deep into anything mentioned. It’s basically a timeline of a woman’s life from 1941-2006 punctuated by both historical events and random life shit specific to Ernaux.
The parts about growing up as a French girl of her socio-economic status in the 40s-50s, and then experiencing the country transition to a more equal place for women had me interested. If this had a consistent feminist lens I imagine I would have enjoyed it more, but it really seems to lose its focus in the second 1/2, last 1/3rd especially, and seems to get more disjointed.
I’m sorry but I’d rather just read a history book and get a complete picture. To me, writing a book centered on memory and the passage of time is a worn-out concept. At least it’s a woman that’s doing it this time.
Also I don’t like her prose style.","Amelia"
"The Years by Annie Ernaux – it spans from Ernaux’s birth in 1940 to 2006. It is not a biography in a traditional sense as it is told as ‘we’ but Ernaux tells both her story and that of her generation. The book felt like a chronicle, record of facts, but I could feel Ernaux’s passion, somewhat disguised but yet coming through. I absolutely loved her references to writers, artists, politicians and I took note of many to learn more about them. Her language can feel raw at times and I like that too. That book is a keeper for me, I have it in Polish beautifully published by Czarne.

"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Memory, Time, Education Writing.
The four things that stood out to me very much in Annie Ernaux’s The Years— the winner of the Nobel prize in literature this year, 2022.
I picked this short book very randomly— I was bored with my other current reads and the Nobel prize was just announced around this time. Of a curiosity about why Annie Ernaux was chosen as the laureate, I picked up the book and am glad to say that now, I know why she won.
The Years was a beautiful, breathless piece of writing about time—-about Annie Ernaux but not limited to her own self. Honestly, it's much more fitting that this is an autobiography of a generation.
Taling or instead reminiscing the things that happened from the 1940s to 2007.
There is something nostalgic in Annie Ernaux’s way of laying moments in her life down in the book. I am not a french person yet reading what the french kids did way back in her childhood still gave me this feeling of nostalgia.
It's also fascinating to see the passage of time here— the narrator growing up from being a kid to a woman in her sixties. The historical event she experienced reminisced— all the wars, all the revolutions, the turn of the century; the feeling of transitioning from 1900 to 2000 and how underwhelming it is—it was like watching a life taking shape.
Annie Ernaux’s Prose too pioneered the greatness of the book. The content was already great, but Ernaux’s way of writing with such rawness and intimacy, and beauty elevated everything to heaven.
Aside from memory and time, Ernaux also wrote about her desire to write and what is education for her. The desire to study and write makes you want to change the world and cement yourself in history, which I could relate to heavily.
And there are also moments so raw that it felt invasive to read. It felt like I have read something from a diary that I was not supposed to see yet it captivated me because of its immense beauty and intimacy, which made me just emotional from reading it.
Quotes that resonated with me very much;
about memory:
Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual difference and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation
about mother:
When it comes to her mother, she remembers the eyes, the hands, the silhouette; the voice, only in the abstract, without texture. The real voice is lost; she has no concrete remnant of it. But phrases often rise to her lips spontaneously, the same ones her mother used in the same contexts, expressions she didn’t remember ever using herself, “The weather is sluggish,” “He talked my ear off,” “You have to wait your turn, like at confession,” etc. It was if her mother were speaking through her mouth, and with her an entire lineage. Other phrases come into her head sometimes, the ones her mother used after she got Alzheimer’s. Their incongruity revealed her mother’s altered mental state, “You can bring me some rags to wipe my bottom with.” In a flash, her mother’s body and presence are returned to her. Unlike the former sentences, repeatedly used, the latter are unique, forever the preserve of one sole being in the world, her mother.
about Writing:
To see her in the photo, a handsome solid girl, one would never suspect that more than anything, she fears going mad. Only writing—or perhaps a man—can protect her from that, if only momentarily. She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
About education:
It seems to her that education is more than just a way to escape poverty. It is a weapon of choice against stagnation in a kind of feminine condition that arouses her pity, the tendency to lose oneself in a man, which she has experienced (see the high school photo from five years before) and of which she is ashamed. She feels no desire to marry or have children. Mothering and the life of the mind seem incompatible. In any case, she’d be sure to be a bad mother. Her ideal is the union libre in the poem by André Breton. At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels “hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories,” that she is “looking for another language” and “longs to return to an original purity.” She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are “little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night.” Other sentences contradict this lassitude: “I am a will and a desire.” She does not say for what.
About aging:
She feels no age difference with women of forty-five or fifty, an illusion which the latter destroy in the course of conversation, without malice but implying that she doesn’t belong to the same generation as they, and is seen by them in the way she herself sees a woman of eighty, i.e., old. Unlike adolescence, when she was sure of not being the same from one year or even one month to the next, now she feels immutable in a world that moves ahead in leaps and bounds.","Ben Martizz"
"I can see why this book won a Nobel Prize. It captures the life of an unnamed woman from childhood to old age. It is done in a very readable way. I really enjoyed it.","Brie"
"Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it’s slipping by, but at the same time “progress” has landed us in a place we no longer recognize.
New York Times
I appreciated the history lesson and the honesty in this memoir. Many such essay collections become a laundry list of complaints but this memoir was diverse in topic and nuanced in explanation. It is a cruel irony that the bottle sitting by the sink that bleaches your hair to the shade of blond you wanted so badly is brought to you by the same corporations that you complain about pushing the latest toasters.","cycads and ferns"
"We had such a nice discussion of this memoir in our book club. I kind of let the details wash over me and didn't worry about things that were too French for me to understand. I appreciated the events she chose to highlight and the ones she left out (for example, an American memoirist of her era would certainly have addressed the Civil Rights Movement while I had to do some light research on Algeria which is clearly more important in France). Once we moved into events in my lifetime, I was even more engaged.","Andrea"
"All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.
[...]
Save something from the time where we will never be again.","michelle"
"This book depicts and relies heavily on cultural and social references from its author’s French background, which often makes it indecipherable to the reader that is not familiar with this context. This was very frustrating, as these references are just too many and make the backbone of the whole narrative. Otherwise, some parts are beautifully written.","Ana de Oliveira Casella"
"this honestly took me a while to get into due to the writing style (i got this book at the beginning of the year) but now that i’ve finished it, i am in complete awe.
a beautiful piece of work that is an innovative and captivating take on social history.","bilqees"
"Overlapping personal and historic narrative of a woman born during second world war in a working class environment in France. Runs till 2006, as she witnesses and records events- personal and public through these years of her life.","Sulthana"
"« sauver quelque chose du temps où l’on ne sera plus jamais »
a masterpiece that makes you nostalgic of an era you’ve never known, a tale of the banal and the common, the life of a woman born in the 40' in france","Lili"
"Biography as a social commentary, hooks you right from the first page and the stream of consciousness just reels you in and doesn't let you go till the very last syllable.
Charming.","Sookie"
"Just unbelievable, one of those books that feels like it is ready to be a classic in the next couple of decades, and cements Ernaux as one of my favourite writers ever","Oliver Shrouder"
"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.
""Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ""a kind of woman's destiny"" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself.""","Adam Dalva"
"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.
The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”
Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.
Some of the things we read about:
Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.
We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.
As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.
(This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)
The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?
There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”
The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.
Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.
But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]
The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”
I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”
Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.
Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.
I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.
This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.
“The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year.
This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.
I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war.....
And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.
The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).
“I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”
“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me.
Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.
“Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.
“We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”.
“But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.
“She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.
The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars.
They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors.
The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier:
“From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”.
There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.
Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence.
She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.
The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris
I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours -
I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars.
I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.
Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.
What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.
Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.
Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.
When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.
Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.
I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.
When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.
I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.
Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .
Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.
I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.
Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"
"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“
Annie Ernaux wrote this ""Les Années/The Years"" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. ""La Place"" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.
Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to ""grasp"" her own life: to tell it from a personal, ""I"" point of view, or rather from an impersonal ""she""? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”
Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person (""she/elle""), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal ""one/on"". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.
This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.
Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the ""spirit"" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.
This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.
Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"
"Wow!
For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!
Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.
The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.
In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!
Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.
I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.
Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.
As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.
I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.
We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.
…we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.
The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.
Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.
Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?
Three stars, it is.
Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.
I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women.
____________________
Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.
This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life
Memory like sexual desire never endse
An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel.
I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up.
Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence
The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone.
To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.
Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure
Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary
A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'
Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.
This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.
The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.
In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.
I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.
Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.
For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!
Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.
I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.
The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.
Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019
This is a very enjoyable ""impersonal autobiography"", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.
I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.
The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the ""evenements"" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner
Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.
The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.
The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in ""an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true:
la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite ""l'autosociobiographie"" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique.
https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...
(translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.)
and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.
The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample
All the images will disappear:
the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café
the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence
...
the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot
...
the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands
the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’
...
the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep
the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:
The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.
They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments
the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war
the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle
the looted shops
the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money
the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation
Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market
Propaganda
the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses
the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.
But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.
The line ""everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events"" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ""one"" and ""we,"" as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.
The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.
(* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)
Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of ""elle"" rather than ""je"" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:
J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais ""elle"" et pas ""je.""
Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:
It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.
This reference to ""the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette"" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:
In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant.
...
On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.'
...
As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.
Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.
For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:
Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.
It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.
But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.
The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.
Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported:
Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.
“I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview.

And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"
"I couldn't decide between a 3 and a 5 rating. This book took me so long to read because it never grabbed me, but it had moments of such poignancy and beauty. I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using ""me"" or ""I""). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"
"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.
Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.
Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.
We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.
Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.
She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.
There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.
She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.
She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.
The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.
She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.
""Years"" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.
A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.
Женщина и утраченное время
Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности.
Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.
""Годы"" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.
Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.
Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.
Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.
Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.
Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и ""черноногие"" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.
А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот момент: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.
Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать туда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, Жоскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.
До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.
Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example
“the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”
Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.
This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.
And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.
For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.
This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.
Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?
Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:
There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.
Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).
The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.
But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"Elusive
What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.
Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.
Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism.
I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.","Karen·"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.
I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman. She writes about social history and the changing society in France during the period 1950s to 2000s. She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration. The narrator married and had two sons and a daughter. She was a teacher all her working life and always planned to write a book.
First published in 2008. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Booker International Prize.","George"
"115th book of 2022.
I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.
The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion.

"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*
""We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.""
I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.
One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.
""Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough,
perhaps even sinful . . .""
—Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs
I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.
The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ���I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.""
Most of the book is quotable but here are a few:
Change of Values over time
""Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc.""
""They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer.""
Development of language
""We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt.""
On arrival of television
""Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction.""
On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)
""With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.""
On arrival of Internet
""The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.
In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.""
On click-happy culture
""We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
Commercialisation
""Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal.""
""In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own.""
Still true for Indians
You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:
""For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society.""
""At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.""","Sidharth Vardhan"
"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?”
Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)
Let the great world spin.
A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.
But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.
A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.
A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.
A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.
A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"
"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.
This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting. Ernaux has many quotable observations about France from 1940 through 2007, but the lack of characters or narration make the list of memories tedious and eminently put-down-able.","Karine"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now.","Olga"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable.
Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography.
The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes,
there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)
Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.
In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop.
I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable.
* The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”.
*Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady.
* The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK.
*There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated
“France cannot take on all the misery of the world”
As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.
I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.

• Class, not like gender. Not a big subject in literature. Since mid c.20th more working class; not just bourgeoise/middle class
• Three short books. Angry. About me
• A Man’s Place About father; a big change for me; now more complex
• Don’t think in terms of joy or pain. Explore things unsaid.
• A Girl’s Story. Calamitous first sexual experience
• Not ideological or feminist
• Diaries. Getting Lost 10 years old. Had forgotten
• Very religious education
• Literature has potential to be moral. Shies from “love”. Celine is moral
• Form. Subject determines the form. The Black Workshop (in French) Expresses doubts about writing process
• Writes several manuscripts, then one will take over.
• Irretrievability of the passage of time. Collective, not just personal time.
• Reveal & examine past injustices; not judgement but reparation. Beyond aesthetic- something useful.
• Jean Luc Goddard & Margaret Duras. No relevance, just a spectacle","Jonathan Pool"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.

I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?
Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.
But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.
And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).
And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.
Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.
4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.
PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).
While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.
But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”
When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much?
“To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.”
But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.
If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself.
“Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”
and
“We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.”
The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’.
“The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”
and
“Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”
and
“In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’”
There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth.
“The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”
And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.
This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.
There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.
… There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save
[list of 14 things]
To save something from the time where we will never be again.
That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says ""devouring the present as it goes."" In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- ""To save something from the time where we will never be again."" And that is the point.","LindaJ^"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.
The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.
Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”
Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.
It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.
In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.","Raul"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.
‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.
As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.
Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural ""we,"" rather than the singular ""I,"" writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.
I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.
Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.
I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.
Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English.","Vanya"
"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’
All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.
Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.
‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’
‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.
This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.
And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"
"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time
-mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour
There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it
Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age
At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.
She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.
We needed to ""re-source"" ourselves. The ""roots"" imperative prevailed.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (""Solitude,"" etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between ""I"" and ""she"". There is something too permanent about ""I,"" something shrunken and stifling, whereas ""she"" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.
Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.
She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, ""the palimpsest sensation""...
...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.","Atri"
"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.
What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.
So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:
From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.
Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.
(Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)
---
Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so ""novels"" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of ""A Woman's Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....
And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it ""impersonal autobiography"" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.
It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"
"""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"" Annie Ernaux from the book.
I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.
It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.
Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.
It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.
The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"
"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.
First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.
What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.
Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.
Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"As the author writes in the book:
There is no ""I"" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.
This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.
Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.
Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.

"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography
Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.
She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.
She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.
Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.
At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.
She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.
The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.
Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"a patchwork made from a life of a woman, a country, the world. this is a precise and sensible observation of the changes that have been taking place both personally and publicly for the past sixty years. there is sharp thinking, deep feeling, and honest storytelling on every page.","Anastasiia Mozghova"
"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”
That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:
“All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”
“She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”
The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.
Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"
"“an impersonal autobiography”
a very long series of “time marks” as she calls them.
The book was very sad and the writing aloof.","Jane Wiewora"
"really excellent
“Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos-
tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and
Simone de Beauvoir.”
“No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear
herself away from to master the language of philos-
ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure
consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”
“She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out
of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“
“In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an
encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these
inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together
with the story of her existence, starting with her
birth during World War II up until the present day.
Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”
“There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented
an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this
ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book.
.
It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated.
.
I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally.
.
The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues.
.
I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it)","Abbie | ab_reads"
"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.
It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.
I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive...","MJ Beauchamp"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"I liked parts of this but then other parts really lost my interest. It kept waning and then she’s talk about something really interesting and it would grab my attention again, but then move onto something I wasn’t enjoying. I feel like I will really like Annie Ernaux the more I explore her so going to read some of her other work and hopefully like it better.","Rachel Louise Atkin"
"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"So good it almost made me like the Fr*nch","Olivia"
"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.
Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"
"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞
★★★.5
the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.

"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"65 years of social history told in 227 pages. Fascinating and mind-boggling, it’ll take me a while to recover from the intensity of this book!","Jennifer"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.
It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”
It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"

"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural ""we"" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or ""freeze-frames"") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.
I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. ""We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man."" Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.
Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. ""The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."" .... ""From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person."" .... ""With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north.""
Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's ""we"" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. ""And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them.""
I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this ""slippery narrative."" The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.
All I can say is that it is not my favourite.
Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.
Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:
They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.
While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:
Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.
In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.
The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”
But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.
As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:
Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.
One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:
In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.
I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:
Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’.
She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again…
And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?
As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “
We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.
Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:
We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.
The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine.
In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.
As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:
The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.

"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.
The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous)
The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"

the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.
this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.
as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.
Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.
This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"

"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.
This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.
I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.
Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.
So good. Beyond brilliant.
Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.
The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.
I'll have to read it again.","John Purcell"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.
Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.
It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.
I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.
I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.
The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.
The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)
Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.
Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.
To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.
This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.
After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.""
Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural ""we"", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.
Ernaux also avoids the use of ""I"" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person ""she"", to distance herself in what she calls an ""impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before"". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to ""save something from the time where we will never be again.""","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"“To write is to fight forgetting.”
I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.
What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found
something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation
“In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”
something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex
“Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”
something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)
“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”
something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone.
I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism.
I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"

"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"

"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"
"quite possibly one of the top 5 best books I’ve ever read, a resolute masterpiece, someone who through sincere, melancholy honesty Fucking Gets It. I am tremendously lucky to have walked into McNally Jackson one day, seen it on a display table, and picked it up.","Katie"
"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.
I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"
"A brilliantly original and eminently readable narrative form in which History is refracted through the Self, like sunlight through stained glass, in the process dissolving that very self, and all that's left is a threadbare accumulation of decomposing memories, and the remaining non-self, emptied, at a further remove.","Avery"
"A memoir unlike any other. A sequence of images and memories that chronicles France since the Second World War. Vivid, honest. Small details and sweeping changes.","Rosamund"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.
I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"
"A masterclass in French History from 1940s till early 2000s. It's all about cultural/social history, which I love. There are very few personal details, and the collective tense is used throughout to show how this is the memoir of France, not Annie Ernaux.","Maria"
"Incredible, unsurprisingly","Aliénor Manteau"
"more impressive in form than in storytelling. rlly hard to get into and pretty inaccessible if you don’t want to spend time researching 1960s French pop culture and politics but it did what it set out to do well and had great nuggets in there … maybe it is telling that all of the parts of the book I connected with were the personal vignettes, which is ironic. I feel bad for bringing this book to like three different countries with me omg she looks like shit","Bean"
"Everyone go to your local bookshop/library and pick up an Annie Ernaux book, any Annie Ernaux book, and allow your life to be changed forever. The enormity of this memoir is heart-rending!","Andrea"
"This is a masterpiece","Cia K."
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.
Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine."" (p.169-170)
Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create.
While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.
The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic ""we"". ""We"" read Simone de Beauvoir and ""we"" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"
"I read most of this on a train ride and it was the best time of my life. I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"

"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"

"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.
I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.
Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”
As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.
For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.
I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.
More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.
I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.","Gregory"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with ""All the images will disappear"" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.
I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.
In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.
Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.
And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person ""she."" The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.
The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.
In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said ""You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!"". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me ""What is that?"". Dad was pointing to a copy of the ""Special Edition"" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him ""Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony"". Dad immediately said ""Buy the Special Edition!"". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!
We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed ""Language of game: English"". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.
Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing ""Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?"". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!
Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.
Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? ""I'll get a coffee"" being replaced with ""I'll get a Starbucks"". ""That bag looks stunning!"" being replaced by ""That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!"". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!
Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!
Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.
I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of ""a generation"", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as ""she"". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.
i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.
i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.
something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.
not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:
It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called ""youths from immigrant backgrounds"", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.
also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.
what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.
finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think ""a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective"" or that it was ""an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations."" i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.
anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).
The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.
In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.
She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)
By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.
Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.
She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to ""save something of that time that never will be again"", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s (""which we never called the zeroes"") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.
Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.
there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.
ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.
near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.
but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to ""capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes"" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of ""consumer society"" and technological ""progress"" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.
A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"
"Such an interesting read - I loved the way she travels through time, reflecting on how bigger events affected the broader social consciousness while remaining deeply personal through the details. The form and prose were beautiful. I know I'd find something new if I read it again, and I'd like to read more of her","Lia Perkins"

"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"
"It does precisely what the author wants it to do: ""By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.""","Jee Koh"
"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣

I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"

"I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.
I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"

"genius, there are parts of this book when she reflects on memory and the senses that it feels like reading thoughts i've never been able to write out. i adored every single moment","billyhs"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"

"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).
This books is a ""generational"" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.
Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, ""a mangled French mixed with local dialects"" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).
My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as ""the days of restrictions were at an end"" (p37). ""We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches"" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine.
p 110: ""And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic ""Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?"" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified."" This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. ""For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations"" (p129) ""She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be"" (p169).
There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: ""And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful..."". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.
A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.
A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.
In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.
This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.
This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story.
Until I realized all of this is THE story.
Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.
‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’
I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’
I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.
Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.
It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.
'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”
I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’
Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).
In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.
Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.
'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'
'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’
…
'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.
'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"
"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.
The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,""there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote"". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. ""She was convinced that she has no personality.""
In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.
Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"Rating: 4.5
I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.
Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.
What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).
Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as ""she"", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a ""we"". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the ""palimpsest sensation"" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
"There is existential relaxation in reading a life as a window on history. It's her story but it could be anyone's. At the same time, it is very specifically a story that takes place in France.","Siobhan Hypatia"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008.
The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she’ of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of ""we"" and ""they"" and ""she"" rather than ""I"" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.
Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"Such a moving, deeply human book on collective history and being a woman in the world.","Teo Mechea"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...
What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.
Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"
"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women. The prose has quality but a bit too hectic for me, as if the author wondered whether this is really a story worth being told to everyone, or more an intimate exercise of archiving memories in a diary.","Virginia del Río"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"
"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"
"Autobiographical novel with interesting POV (with which I had some big problems) is told in snippets, from postwar years till present time.

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.

"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be ""riveting"": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"

"This is my review of Ernaux's The Years, published first at LA Review of Books:
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
""Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.""
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
""All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
""Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.""
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.
The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using ""we"" and ""us"" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.
Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.
Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.

"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural ""We"" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the ""we"" is the ""we"" of students or progressives.
The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.
Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:
By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.","Scott"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later.
--------Full Review-----------------------------
4.5 stars
""Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty...""
'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.
Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.
When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.
Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...
I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.
From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.
Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.
Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.
Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.
A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.
The story is told through a collage of ""moments"" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.
Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.
She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past.
All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.
The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.
Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.
Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"
"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.
This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.
SUCH a groundbreaking idea.","Maryam"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny
If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.
Here are two of my favorite quotes:
""At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what.""
""I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.""","Eliza Saftyuk"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using ""she"" and ""we,"" but never ""I."" Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.
But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.
To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.
There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.
In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.
“Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"
"'She would like to assemble the multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day [...] an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.'
.
This is an incredible book, a kind of collective autobiography that takes in the sweep of social and political change in France from the 1940s to today. It's also a generous yet critical account of how people have chosen to live, from their occupations and acquisition of things to marriage and family meals. It's an engrossing read.","Emily"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.
The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.
From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said ""No"", however, after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?
In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a ""collective history via my feelings and recollections"" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun ""we"" and the gender-neutral pronoun ""one"", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as ""she"" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.
The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.
Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative, however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a ""collective autobiography"" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.
The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"In Annie Ernaux's ""impersonal autobiography"", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun ""I"", she uses instead the pronouns ""we"" or ""she"" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses ""people"". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and ""speeds"" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.

"In her autobiography, ""The Years"", Annie Ernaux leads the reader down the 60 year path of her life. She uses historical events as the back drop to her story, touching on the chaos of political life in France, grappling with changes in French society, as well as accepting the ever-undulating phases in her life and that of her family, with calm and serenity. There are no chapters, but rather cleverly spaced paragraphs that indicate the continuation of commentary, the ends of thoughts, and the beginning of new years. Ernaux rebounds between pronouns, using ""she"", ""we"", ""one"", to personalize and also collectively describe events in her close life, and in the life of her larger environment. My edition included comments by the translator that I would recommend reading in advance of diving into ""The Years"", as it will allow you to connect with Ernaux's intelligent techniques from the beginning. Also, there are many references to historical events in France, all of which some readers may not be aware; however her struggles with who she is and what she is becoming, are universal and heart-felt in their sincerity. ""The Years"" is a flowing journey of events, both personal and historical, beautifully articulated by Ernaux.","Rochelle"

Reading this book now makes me reflect on how I want to live but more importantly how I want to remember it, especially in a world where digital technologies dominate.

"A lot of French references that went over my head but still a beautiful story abt life and womanhood","Darci Jones"
"This is a patchwork-book, between autobiography and nonfiction, telling the life of its author and of her generation in parallel. Some overarching themes were present throughout the book, a bridge between the author’s interests and the objective markers of her generation: feminism and the sexual liberation, capitalism and the société de consommation that ensued, the interest in world events and social causes, among other things.
As I was born in 1996, I came too late even for the latest events in the book: I remember the change of currency in 2002, from franc to euro, because we had to give the franc coins back, but that’s it. I didn’t live in that time, I have no nostalgy for it, but I liked that it helped me understand quite a lot about the current France.
Annie Ernaux talks a lot about the sexual liberation and the empowerment of women thanks to the pill and the abortion, as well as the right to *finally* talk about it. This right to talk about sex seems to have crystallized in an imperative: to show that you weren’t a prude, that you weren’t easily shocked, you had to use crude words. I know that my grandmother has never gotten over this particular powermove, and still loves using crude words and doing forbidden things (like breaking traffic laws at 80yo…). It always bothered me, but now I think it's partly a generational thing, the appeal of what was previously forbidden.
There’s also a lot on the subject of consumption, capitalism and globalization. The fascination with modern objects, the showing off, the difficulty to adapt for older people, etc. And on the subject of globalization, I was kind of shocked to realize that it was much easier for the previous generations to share the same cultural references. They read the same French authors and philosophers, liked the same French and American singers, watched the same TV channels and news reports, etc.
I wonder how integrated in this 20th century she really was: she only talks about 20th century, but is it caused by the constraints of the book (where she mostly shows the ways her life and her generation’s history intersect) or by a genuine appetite for newness at the time, that she also shared? She did say at some point that her generation thought 20th century books felt more appealing and worth reading than older classics. Was it an effect of the postwar era, this rejection of everything from before the war?
This mix of autobiography/nonfiction was particularly jarring for me. This focus on the 'generational' parts of her life means that she omitted her personal feelings towards friends and family members. The timeless human traits, unrelated to the big themes listed above, only appeared in passing. Which I thought made her seem distant and materialistic (who cares about frozen peas and product brands!), which she probably wasn’t. So it’s a distorted kind of autobiography! I knew it in a distant kind of way, but in practice I constantly forgot about it, and thought: okay, but how did she really feel about her ex-husband? and her new boyfriend, apart from the fact that he makes her feel younger?
And when she presents her generation as a united front on all the big themes listed above, she’s not trying for objectivity or inclusivity. Which is very obvious, but I wanted to read these ""we""-sentences as nonfiction, as universal truths of her generation. So she was talking about how ""we"" adulated Sartre and Simon de Beauvoir, and I thought, wait, that's not true, I know someone born in the 40's who can't stand them. Oh, right, not nonfiction either.
Unrelated to the autobiography/nonfiction genre-bending content, the prose was beautiful, épurée (""uncluttered"", but there must be a better translation?) and made me want to read more in French.","Joséphine"
"Really stunning, some of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read are contained in this novel. A unique way of storytelling, History (capital H) as a collective memory grounded in our individual experiences. Ernaux is searching for that lost time, or as she writes herself: ""To save something from the time where we will never be again.""
A story that begins in the shadow of World War II and ends with children playing the Nintendo Wii.
Truly to have grown up in this period of time is unique and exceptional in the Human experience - even from our arrogant posing in the 21st century with all our gadgets and received wisdom it cannot be denied how Historically, socially, individually exceptional a life between c. 1949-2008 would have been. (Part of this is how it feels like Time has become Flattened by the advent of social media, the digital world et al - can we really say we can differentiate between 2010 and 2019? Perhaps, actually, but I'm skeptical as of right now)
Stunning passages that are intimately familiar to myself (as a damned 'Gen Z') - globalisation, societal decay at the end of history, the dizzying effects of limitless consumption and digitalisation. ""We never stopped wanting to click on 'save' and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, a new social use of photos [...] What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded was we were living it [...] With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
The chunk of time spent on the late 50s through to the 60s-70s were, of course, my favourite passages. Vivid, loved, large, and most of all feeling ~important~. Figures that I have only ever seen in the past tense are living and breathing in this period - Camus, De Beauvoir, Barthes, Anna Karina, Godard - until they aren't, and they are mourned. Can you believe a million people walked behind Sartre's coffin?

"DNF at 100 pages
Surprised by how popular this book is considering it is so inaccessible to people who did not live in France. Too many references dropped in assuming the reader shares the same background made for hard reading.","Adna"
"Unreal. There isn’t anything I can imagine comparing it to- it seems to invent and subvert genre at the same time. Since Ernaux won the Nobel Prize, I’ve finally gotten around to reading her, having started with A Man’s Place and A Woman’s Story. To say this is a total departure in tone and style is an understatement- the terseness of those and other of her books is traded for a decadence of detail and sensation in The Years. It’s not a memoir, not a history- it’s something else. Totally compelling.","Brian"
"This book will probably be one of those that I will pick up again and again throughout the years. The sheer amount of passages that I highlighted speaks for itself (as you can see on the photo at the top of this post). From stylistically beautiful phrases, to clever observations or reflections on life as a woman that inspire to search for similar ones in one's own life. I think that depending on the age that you read this book at, different parts might speak to you more. I'd compare it to the phenomenon of the ""Sex and the City"" TV series, which you can watch an endless amount of times. Depending on the issues that you're going through in your life at that specific moment, you'd be noticing bits and pieces that you haven't paid attention to before, which I can see happening with this book as well.
My only issue with ""The Years"" was that it was too France-centric and it was impossible for me to fully get the meaning of all things referenced. Having started reading it in French, I quickly switched over to the English translation because I felt like I couldn't follow the storyline properly. It's only after diving into the translation that I realised that it was difficult to keep up with it in English as well. Cultural references like songs, singers, kids' rhymes, TV shows, movies, actors, as well as numerous historical events, both very big and very small, were mentioned, which I have never heard of before. I can see somebody French really enjoying this book more and it's the only reason why I personally decided to reduce one star from the final rating. Here an example of what many passages will read like:
the dashing figure of the actor Philippe Lemaire, married to Juliette Gréco [...]
of Elizabeth Drummond, murdered with her parents on a road in Lurs in 1952
p. 13
It became shameful to hope for revolution, and we didn't dare admit that we were saddened by Ulrike Meinhof's suicide in prison. Through some obscure reasoning, Althusser's crime of choking his wife to death in bed one Sunday morning was blamed as much on the Marxism he embodied as on any kind of mental problem.
p. 122
If you were to look up the details of each of those descriptions (which I was trying to do in the beginning), you would get a really detailed understanding of the French society and their collective memory. I couldn't stick to it throughout the whole book though, as it kept interrupting the reading flow. Nevertheless, imagining the author putting together the sheer amount and the details of these events, selecting the most significant ones for each year or each decade, was definitely impressive. The choice of the footnotes was therefore quite interesting, how some things were explained and others weren't. In my case I would have needed about four times more footnotes than the amount that was provided. Another specificity that I noticed since I compared the French original and the English translation throughout the first 30 pages, was how I ended up highlighting different passages in each language. I found some phrases more beautiful in French, whereas others spoke to me more in English. I'd therefore surely try reading the book completely in its original version at some point.
notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux du temps
p. 17 (French original)
Sitôt rentrés à la maison, on retrouvait sans y penser la langue originelle, qui n'obligeait pas à réfléchir aux mots, seulement aux choses à dire ou à ne pas dire, celle qui tenait au corps, liée aux paires de claques, à l'odeur d'eau de Javel des blouses, des pommes cuites tout l'hiver, aux bruits de pisse dans le seau et aux ronflements des parents.
p. 35 (French original)
The style the book was written in was definitely something that you would enjoy while reading. I even felt like reading some passages out loud because the rhythm of the words flowed so beautifully! The content was just as fascinating. Seeing the transition of society from the 1940s until 2006 through the shape of a collective memory, as well as influenced by the author's personal stories told in the third person, was definitely something that I haven't read in such a form before. From a society where hardly anyone traveled, hardly threw anything away, up until the current day times in the era of disposability, mobile phones, computers and all types of modern technology. It was really eye-opening, having the speed of how everything in our lives changed in a span of just about 70 years demonstrated in writing.
How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote.
p. 167-168
Nothing was thrown away. The contents of chamber pots were used for garden fertilizer, the dung of passing horses collected for potted plants. Newspaper was used for wrapping vegetables, drying shoes, wiping one's bottom in the lavatory.
p. 37
With digital technology, we drained reality dry.
p. 208
As much as there were parts that were very specific to the French society, there were just as many passages that universally applied. What it means to transition from being a girl, to a teenager, to a woman, the problems you face on the way, the reflections you might have and the transformations that you would go through as a person. All these found expression in ""The Years"" as well. The general idea of the book reminded me of Deborah Levy's autobiography trilogy, consisting of three books: ""Things I Don't Want to Know"" , ""The Cost of Living"" and ""Real Estate"" . Both women speak about what it means to be a writer, the discovery of one's own identity in solitude, going through divorce and life after it, as well as having children and seeing them grow up.
Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write 'a kind of woman's destiny', set between 1940 and 1985. It would be [...] a 'total novel' that would end with her dispossession of people and things: parents and husband, children who leave home, furniture that is sold.
p. 148
When she can't sleep at night, she tries to remember the details of all the rooms where she has slept: the one she shared with her parents until the age of thirteen, the ones at the university residence and the Annecy apartment facing the cemetery.
p. 166
I was extremely glad to have discovered the book and the author for the first time thanks to the ""Barcelona Women's Book Club"" . I felt like it would be an especially impactful read for women but even taken generally, it was an exceptional piece of writing. I would highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to reading further books by Annie Ernaux.
More reviews on my blog - KHVBooks.com","Veronika"
"Save something from the time where we will never be again. This was the final quote and I think the ultimate message of the book. I enjoyed reading it, the author's writing style is truly remarkable. The book had plenty very detailed references to French sociopolitical events of 21st century that an average non French reader would not know but that did not prevent me from enjoying every bit of it.","Arpi"
"We joked, “God is dead, Marx is dead, and I don’t feel so good either.” We had a sense of play.
Play is a good term. Ernaux is playing with memory. It is her story. She was born in France during the Second World War, as she recalls the hardships on her family, the rebuilding of the country and their zeal to forget what happened. She grows up, goes to college, becomes a teacher, talks about sex and abortion (told in another book), gets married, has children, gets disallusioned with marriage, it ends, starts life anew, has an affair with a younger man (another book too), retires and reflects on her life, her country and history. Sixty-five years.
It is also look back at the latter half of the twentieth century. It’s our collective history. May 1968, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 911 are landmarks. She covers themes like politics, sexual politics, war (there are a lot of them and how quickly we forget), and global events. Terrorism, racism, immigration, feminism, and religion. It reflects on how technology has changed us, slowly at first then it’s everywhere. It is a tale of us.
She speaks to us in third person and never singles herself out. It’s not really an autobiography but rather a recalling of life and events of this time. Her story is triggered by Ernaux looking at old photographs, Super 8 movies and videos. That is her play.
Buried in the book is the spark to write this book. What is the “Madeline” that trigger her to write this Proustian tale? Just as Proust reflected on his life, times, loves and events, Ernaux does the same (in much less pages).
It’s her life and our life all wrapped into one continuous story. Impersonal and yet oddly personal. Indelibly odd, beautiful and at times funny. How does our memory work on the past? Are these accurate and does it matter?
So many these events I could relate to which made me realize the common thread that binds us together. She is French and twenty years older than myself but her words triggered my own memories. Perhaps we humans are not as different as we think we are? What binds us together is more than what separates us.
Now I understand why she used the word “we” to describe her life. We really can’t separate ourselves from the world. Our world. Our past. The years.","David"
"Last year I had not heard of Annie Ernaux. Then I began to manage a new bookshop and we got in a range of books from independent publishers. I noticed that Fitzcarraldo seemed to be especially good and have a very high reputation. I had never read any of their books, despite having Second Hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich on my book shelves for years (I still haven't read it yet). Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk is one of our bestselling books, so I read that to see what the fuss was all about, and thought it was great. We were asked to host an event with Joshua Cohen for his book The Netenyahus, so we did, and I thought that novel was great, and it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize the next year. Then they asked if we would host an event for Daisy Hildyard for Emergency, so we did, and I thought it was another excellent novel. But we have more books by Annie Ernaux from Fitzcarraldo then any other writer, and she seems to have a fanbase that consists mostly of intelligent young women, so I picked up The Years a couple of months ago. Just as I decided it was time to read it Ernaux won the Nobel Prize.
This is the best Fitzcarraldo book I have read yet, and I think it's one of the best books of the 21st Century so far. It is a marvellous book, blending together autobiography, history and sociology in a very literary style. Ernaux reveals and crafts the sweep of her life, from being born into a relatively poor provincial family during WW2, through the social, political and material transformations that took place in French society in the decades that follow as she experiences the youth rebellion of the 50' and 60's, ascends into the bourgeoise, becomes a teacher, a wife and mother, experiences the revolutionary moment of May 68, and the political disappointment and cynicism that follows in the subsequent decades.
I cannot do the book justice with this description. I think it is one of the essential books of the 21st century. I can't think of a British writer operating at this level. And we should be very thankful to Fitzcarraldo for bringing the best literature in the world into being, and into English.","Darran Mclaughlin"
"Superb and highly original.
Besides being a pretty marvellous meditation on ageing and memory, this is such a simple (ha) and utterly sensible idea. Namely, that you are a product of your time, so what better way to write about a life than to retell it, overwhelmingly (but not exclusively), through the events and conventions of the age you lived through. It's so obvious that I can't believe it isn't seen more in fiction. And yes, that question: is it fiction (yes, surely). I love it how French lit keeps pushing the boundaries like this.
It's all rather moving and it's hard not to feel quite powerful empathy for the subject (I'd compare it a bit to 'The Up Series'). I for one found myself - dare I say it - feeling greater understanding of the Boomer generation (though actually these guys are older - they're more like Wartime Generation,,,though they were young in '68 too) and the cultural turns they experienced. By which I mean: growing up in a world where you had to get married to have sex and wearing lipstick was seen as whore-like...to letting your offspring have their their girlfriend stay over. No wonder they were a bit confused and contorted.
As the years a pass, ones own memories come into view...which, in a way, adds to the interest.
I'm not sure if this is Annie Ernaux's 'method', but it's very readable and makes for a kind of literary documentary. A sort of : this is what we were like. The only example in English of that voice I can remember is 'And Then We Came to the End' dealing in an entirely different realm. It works extremely well. As an observer of Francophonie and France in a permanent state of trying to catch up and fill in gaps, it's almost prefect reading for me. I hope the English version does well.
Oh by the way: the name of the pub in Finchley is the 'Tally Ho Corner'. I had to Google 'Telly O'Corner' to check if this was something she'd dreamed. It's a sweet example of bad-memory Chinese Whispers. Bravo.","Jake Goretzki"
"We are reading Annie Ernaux and we are very delighted. 'The Year's' promises an authorship that will enjoy us with more books with similar high class. We think it must be their best choice since Jose Saramago, in purely egoistic terms. We like it, that we understand, become engaged, enjoyed and feel as a part of even the literary world.
We sometimes have felt all stupid again, from choices we couldn't even understand. We felt it was too prudish at times. An ill smelling snobbery pricing literature for a tiny group of writers with a symbolism of no general availability for other cultures. We felt ashamed when Sweden, again, was priced. We felt cheated when our favourites never got it. They hate predictability, which is something we still, also, like about them. We don't like when they make statements though. Giving a brilliant singer, writing good local journalism this price we realise they are being unaware of biases and the effects on music to dope lyrics with qualities of moment. You don't have to keep the words moving with thinking, since music makes them seem alive in a not very magical way.
But only a week with the francophile choice of Annie Ernaux we are already very delighted. We got ourselves an author not unknown to focus on. We think of Ali Smith reading and are filled with joy, although it's less general (arguably), and packed with references only referring to France. We long to read another book by her, while still reading the first one. We don't forgive this noble institution but we know that people in power through all ages have tremendous collective disabilities in mentalisation. We are ourselves expressing views on topics without that much knowledge on them, or how they will be understood by others. And we are only one.","Anders Demitz-Helin"
"The Years is a slender book, but feels epic, spanning 70-years during the author's coming of age and life in France. While I can't deny that many of the major political events, figures, and movements felt foreign to me as an American, what makes The Years absorbing and unique is they way Ernaux captures a nation's feelings and experiences in relation to significant historic events, and renders them as universal. Through an inventive and original form of ""collective autobiography"" she presents, as she puts it, “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” It's a style that immediately sucks you in and makes you feel like an empathetic participant, even if you're an outsider.
For such an intellectual work, The Years could have been stuffy and impenetrable, but instead finds the right balance between niche, European, auto-fic and accessible, mainstream memoir. This is a book in which you can find the author's thoughts on French society, history, and politics bumping up against modern cultural touch-points like H&M shopping, mobile phones, the early internet, and Playstation. Add to that Ernaux's stunning prose and perceptive observations, and you have one of the smartest and most captivating non-fiction works of the year.
It's tough to pick a favorite passage, but one for me of many:
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""","Joe M"
"This book really grew on me as the narrative unfolded. The intertwining of personal and collective experience becomes more and more compelling. It is like an intimate memoir written by an entire generation. It is both touching and thought provoking.","Helen"
"Annie's diary covering the years from 1940 to 2006; roughly my peer. Although she talks about growing up and living in France, there are enough parallels between her life and mine as as American female as she watches and analyzes the decades morph and change. The world has changed dramatically from WWII until now, so I can relate to her observations.
“She often revisits images of herself single, in the streets of the cities where she has walked and in the rooms that she has occupied – in a young ladies’ hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair, or in a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The object of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: ‘Out of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not’”… pg 94
“She has lost her sense of the future, a kind of limitless background on which her actions and gestures were once projected, a waiting for all the good and unknown things that lived inside her…” pg 227","Candice"
"I read this novel right before Annie Ernaux was awarded with the Noble Prize, starting it for the second time, after having giving up a first time. Sadly, this novel was not for me. While this autobiography is very cleverly structured, it baffles me to see all the five-star reviews, as I think the text would only need interesting to the French.
To me, the whole book felt like a drawn-out conversation with a bourgeois Frenchman who wants to show how humanitarian he or she is and how everything he or she does is, in fact, done in solidarity with lower-class people. Showing solidarity is obviously not the problem, but rather the fact that this kind of people emphasize it so much, as if they want to get a medal for it.
Stylistically, I initially liked the vignettes about photographs Ernaux describes, but I quickly got tired of the fact that she simply swaps out ""je"" for ""nous"" to make her experiences universal. The meta chapter at the end (about writing this novel) was downright cheesy.","Lotte"
"I dnfed this book because although this was said to be translated, yet it still has a language barrier that I couldn't understand. To keep looking it up every few minutes was getting frustrating. I also did not like the way that this autobiography was written in individual sentence form or in very short paragraph form, it was confusing.
Sexual desire was compared to memories in the same breath as talking about grandparents and parents...bizarre. Things didn't seem to mesh well together or tie in well most of the time.
Some things that the author stated I didn't even understand such as , "" To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.""Huh?
Again, not sure if it a language barrier thing or the way it was written but I only made it a couple chapters before giving up. This is very rare for me , as you can see this is only my second dnf book out of almost 400. I did give this book to a friend, though, here's hoping that she enjoys it more!","Michelle"
"For a book that is pretty much an endless list of summarized French (and occasionally World) history, this just feels so empty. It’s sprawling time-wise for a memoir, but doesn’t go deep into anything mentioned. It’s basically a timeline of a woman’s life from 1941-2006 punctuated by both historical events and random life shit specific to Ernaux.
The parts about growing up as a French girl of her socio-economic status in the 40s-50s, and then experiencing the country transition to a more equal place for women had me interested. If this had a consistent feminist lens I imagine I would have enjoyed it more, but it really seems to lose its focus in the second 1/2, last 1/3rd especially, and seems to get more disjointed.
I’m sorry but I’d rather just read a history book and get a complete picture. To me, writing a book centered on memory and the passage of time is a worn-out concept. At least it’s a woman that’s doing it this time.
Also I don’t like her prose style.","Amelia"
"The Years by Annie Ernaux – it spans from Ernaux’s birth in 1940 to 2006. It is not a biography in a traditional sense as it is told as ‘we’ but Ernaux tells both her story and that of her generation. The book felt like a chronicle, record of facts, but I could feel Ernaux’s passion, somewhat disguised but yet coming through. I absolutely loved her references to writers, artists, politicians and I took note of many to learn more about them. Her language can feel raw at times and I like that too. That book is a keeper for me, I have it in Polish beautifully published by Czarne.

"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Memory, Time, Education Writing.
The four things that stood out to me very much in Annie Ernaux’s The Years— the winner of the Nobel prize in literature this year, 2022.
I picked this short book very randomly— I was bored with my other current reads and the Nobel prize was just announced around this time. Of a curiosity about why Annie Ernaux was chosen as the laureate, I picked up the book and am glad to say that now, I know why she won.
The Years was a beautiful, breathless piece of writing about time—-about Annie Ernaux but not limited to her own self. Honestly, it's much more fitting that this is an autobiography of a generation.
Taling or instead reminiscing the things that happened from the 1940s to 2007.
There is something nostalgic in Annie Ernaux’s way of laying moments in her life down in the book. I am not a french person yet reading what the french kids did way back in her childhood still gave me this feeling of nostalgia.
It's also fascinating to see the passage of time here— the narrator growing up from being a kid to a woman in her sixties. The historical event she experienced reminisced— all the wars, all the revolutions, the turn of the century; the feeling of transitioning from 1900 to 2000 and how underwhelming it is—it was like watching a life taking shape.
Annie Ernaux’s Prose too pioneered the greatness of the book. The content was already great, but Ernaux’s way of writing with such rawness and intimacy, and beauty elevated everything to heaven.
Aside from memory and time, Ernaux also wrote about her desire to write and what is education for her. The desire to study and write makes you want to change the world and cement yourself in history, which I could relate to heavily.
And there are also moments so raw that it felt invasive to read. It felt like I have read something from a diary that I was not supposed to see yet it captivated me because of its immense beauty and intimacy, which made me just emotional from reading it.
Quotes that resonated with me very much;
about memory:
Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual difference and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation
about mother:
When it comes to her mother, she remembers the eyes, the hands, the silhouette; the voice, only in the abstract, without texture. The real voice is lost; she has no concrete remnant of it. But phrases often rise to her lips spontaneously, the same ones her mother used in the same contexts, expressions she didn’t remember ever using herself, “The weather is sluggish,” “He talked my ear off,” “You have to wait your turn, like at confession,” etc. It was if her mother were speaking through her mouth, and with her an entire lineage. Other phrases come into her head sometimes, the ones her mother used after she got Alzheimer’s. Their incongruity revealed her mother’s altered mental state, “You can bring me some rags to wipe my bottom with.” In a flash, her mother’s body and presence are returned to her. Unlike the former sentences, repeatedly used, the latter are unique, forever the preserve of one sole being in the world, her mother.
about Writing:
To see her in the photo, a handsome solid girl, one would never suspect that more than anything, she fears going mad. Only writing—or perhaps a man—can protect her from that, if only momentarily. She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
About education:
It seems to her that education is more than just a way to escape poverty. It is a weapon of choice against stagnation in a kind of feminine condition that arouses her pity, the tendency to lose oneself in a man, which she has experienced (see the high school photo from five years before) and of which she is ashamed. She feels no desire to marry or have children. Mothering and the life of the mind seem incompatible. In any case, she’d be sure to be a bad mother. Her ideal is the union libre in the poem by André Breton. At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels “hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories,” that she is “looking for another language” and “longs to return to an original purity.” She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are “little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night.” Other sentences contradict this lassitude: “I am a will and a desire.” She does not say for what.
About aging:
She feels no age difference with women of forty-five or fifty, an illusion which the latter destroy in the course of conversation, without malice but implying that she doesn’t belong to the same generation as they, and is seen by them in the way she herself sees a woman of eighty, i.e., old. Unlike adolescence, when she was sure of not being the same from one year or even one month to the next, now she feels immutable in a world that moves ahead in leaps and bounds.","Ben Martizz"
"I can see why this book won a Nobel Prize. It captures the life of an unnamed woman from childhood to old age. It is done in a very readable way. I really enjoyed it.","Brie"
"Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it’s slipping by, but at the same time “progress” has landed us in a place we no longer recognize.
New York Times
I appreciated the history lesson and the honesty in this memoir. Many such essay collections become a laundry list of complaints but this memoir was diverse in topic and nuanced in explanation. It is a cruel irony that the bottle sitting by the sink that bleaches your hair to the shade of blond you wanted so badly is brought to you by the same corporations that you complain about pushing the latest toasters.","cycads and ferns"
"We had such a nice discussion of this memoir in our book club. I kind of let the details wash over me and didn't worry about things that were too French for me to understand. I appreciated the events she chose to highlight and the ones she left out (for example, an American memoirist of her era would certainly have addressed the Civil Rights Movement while I had to do some light research on Algeria which is clearly more important in France). Once we moved into events in my lifetime, I was even more engaged.","Andrea"
"All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.

"This book depicts and relies heavily on cultural and social references from its author’s French background, which often makes it indecipherable to the reader that is not familiar with this context. This was very frustrating, as these references are just too many and make the backbone of the whole narrative. Otherwise, some parts are beautifully written.","Ana de Oliveira Casella"
"this honestly took me a while to get into due to the writing style (i got this book at the beginning of the year) but now that i’ve finished it, i am in complete awe.

"Just unbelievable, one of those books that feels like it is ready to be a classic in the next couple of decades, and cements Ernaux as one of my favourite writers ever","Oliver Shrouder"
"This is a patchwork-book, between autobiography and nonfiction, telling the life of its author and of her generation in parallel. Some overarching themes were present throughout the book, a bridge between the author’s interests and the objective markers of her generation: feminism and the sexual liberation, capitalism and the société de consommation that ensued, the interest in world events and social causes, among other things.
As I was born in 1996, I came too late even for the latest events in the book: I remember the change of currency in 2002, from franc to euro, because we had to give the franc coins back, but that’s it. I didn’t live in that time, I have no nostalgy for it, but I liked that it helped me understand quite a lot about the current France.
Annie Ernaux talks a lot about the sexual liberation and the empowerment of women thanks to the pill and the abortion, as well as the right to *finally* talk about it. This right to talk about sex seems to have crystallized in an imperative: to show that you weren’t a prude, that you weren’t easily shocked, you had to use crude words. I know that my grandmother has never gotten over this particular powermove, and still loves using crude words and doing forbidden things (like breaking traffic laws at 80yo…). It always bothered me, but now I think it's partly a generational thing, the appeal of what was previously forbidden.
There’s also a lot on the subject of consumption, capitalism and globalization. The fascination with modern objects, the showing off, the difficulty to adapt for older people, etc. And on the subject of globalization, I was kind of shocked to realize that it was much easier for the previous generations to share the same cultural references. They read the same French authors and philosophers, liked the same French and American singers, watched the same TV channels and news reports, etc.
I wonder how integrated in this 20th century she really was: she only talks about 20th century, but is it caused by the constraints of the book (where she mostly shows the ways her life and her generation’s history intersect) or by a genuine appetite for newness at the time, that she also shared? She did say at some point that her generation thought 20th century books felt more appealing and worth reading than older classics. Was it an effect of the postwar era, this rejection of everything from before the war?
This mix of autobiography/nonfiction was particularly jarring for me. This focus on the 'generational' parts of her life means that she omitted her personal feelings towards friends and family members. The timeless human traits, unrelated to the big themes listed above, only appeared in passing. Which I thought made her seem distant and materialistic (who cares about frozen peas and product brands!), which she probably wasn’t. So it’s a distorted kind of autobiography! I knew it in a distant kind of way, but in practice I constantly forgot about it, and thought: okay, but how did she really feel about her ex-husband? and her new boyfriend, apart from the fact that he makes her feel younger?
And when she presents her generation as a united front on all the big themes listed above, she’s not trying for objectivity or inclusivity. Which is very obvious, but I wanted to read these ""we""-sentences as nonfiction, as universal truths of her generation. So she was talking about how ""we"" adulated Sartre and Simon de Beauvoir, and I thought, wait, that's not true, I know someone born in the 40's who can't stand them. Oh, right, not nonfiction either.
Unrelated to the autobiography/nonfiction genre-bending content, the prose was beautiful, épurée (""uncluttered"", but there must be a better translation?) and made me want to read more in French.","Joséphine"
"Really stunning, some of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read are contained in this novel. A unique way of storytelling, History (capital H) as a collective memory grounded in our individual experiences. Ernaux is searching for that lost time, or as she writes herself: ""To save something from the time where we will never be again.""
A story that begins in the shadow of World War II and ends with children playing the Nintendo Wii.
Truly to have grown up in this period of time is unique and exceptional in the Human experience - even from our arrogant posing in the 21st century with all our gadgets and received wisdom it cannot be denied how Historically, socially, individually exceptional a life between c. 1949-2008 would have been. (Part of this is how it feels like Time has become Flattened by the advent of social media, the digital world et al - can we really say we can differentiate between 2010 and 2019? Perhaps, actually, but I'm skeptical as of right now)
Stunning passages that are intimately familiar to myself (as a damned 'Gen Z') - globalisation, societal decay at the end of history, the dizzying effects of limitless consumption and digitalisation. ""We never stopped wanting to click on 'save' and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, a new social use of photos [...] What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded was we were living it [...] With digital technology, we drained reality dry.""
The chunk of time spent on the late 50s through to the 60s-70s were, of course, my favourite passages. Vivid, loved, large, and most of all feeling ~important~. Figures that I have only ever seen in the past tense are living and breathing in this period - Camus, De Beauvoir, Barthes, Anna Karina, Godard - until they aren't, and they are mourned. Can you believe a million people walked behind Sartre's coffin?

Surprised by how popular this book is considering it is so inaccessible to people who did not live in France. Too many references dropped in assuming the reader shares the same background made for hard reading.","Adna"
"Unreal. There isn’t anything I can imagine comparing it to- it seems to invent and subvert genre at the same time. Since Ernaux won the Nobel Prize, I’ve finally gotten around to reading her, having started with A Man’s Place and A Woman’s Story. To say this is a total departure in tone and style is an understatement- the terseness of those and other of her books is traded for a decadence of detail and sensation in The Years. It’s not a memoir, not a history- it’s something else. Totally compelling.","Brian"
"This book will probably be one of those that I will pick up again and again throughout the years. The sheer amount of passages that I highlighted speaks for itself (as you can see on the photo at the top of this post). From stylistically beautiful phrases, to clever observations or reflections on life as a woman that inspire to search for similar ones in one's own life. I think that depending on the age that you read this book at, different parts might speak to you more. I'd compare it to the phenomenon of the ""Sex and the City"" TV series, which you can watch an endless amount of times. Depending on the issues that you're going through in your life at that specific moment, you'd be noticing bits and pieces that you haven't paid attention to before, which I can see happening with this book as well.
My only issue with ""The Years"" was that it was too France-centric and it was impossible for me to fully get the meaning of all things referenced. Having started reading it in French, I quickly switched over to the English translation because I felt like I couldn't follow the storyline properly. It's only after diving into the translation that I realised that it was difficult to keep up with it in English as well. Cultural references like songs, singers, kids' rhymes, TV shows, movies, actors, as well as numerous historical events, both very big and very small, were mentioned, which I have never heard of before. I can see somebody French really enjoying this book more and it's the only reason why I personally decided to reduce one star from the final rating. Here an example of what many passages will read like:
the dashing figure of the actor Philippe Lemaire, married to Juliette Gréco [...]
of Elizabeth Drummond, murdered with her parents on a road in Lurs in 1952
p. 13
It became shameful to hope for revolution, and we didn't dare admit that we were saddened by Ulrike Meinhof's suicide in prison. Through some obscure reasoning, Althusser's crime of choking his wife to death in bed one Sunday morning was blamed as much on the Marxism he embodied as on any kind of mental problem.
p. 122
If you were to look up the details of each of those descriptions (which I was trying to do in the beginning), you would get a really detailed understanding of the French society and their collective memory. I couldn't stick to it throughout the whole book though, as it kept interrupting the reading flow. Nevertheless, imagining the author putting together the sheer amount and the details of these events, selecting the most significant ones for each year or each decade, was definitely impressive. The choice of the footnotes was therefore quite interesting, how some things were explained and others weren't. In my case I would have needed about four times more footnotes than the amount that was provided. Another specificity that I noticed since I compared the French original and the English translation throughout the first 30 pages, was how I ended up highlighting different passages in each language. I found some phrases more beautiful in French, whereas others spoke to me more in English. I'd therefore surely try reading the book completely in its original version at some point.
notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux du temps
p. 17 (French original)
Sitôt rentrés à la maison, on retrouvait sans y penser la langue originelle, qui n'obligeait pas à réfléchir aux mots, seulement aux choses à dire ou à ne pas dire, celle qui tenait au corps, liée aux paires de claques, à l'odeur d'eau de Javel des blouses, des pommes cuites tout l'hiver, aux bruits de pisse dans le seau et aux ronflements des parents.
p. 35 (French original)
The style the book was written in was definitely something that you would enjoy while reading. I even felt like reading some passages out loud because the rhythm of the words flowed so beautifully! The content was just as fascinating. Seeing the transition of society from the 1940s until 2006 through the shape of a collective memory, as well as influenced by the author's personal stories told in the third person, was definitely something that I haven't read in such a form before. From a society where hardly anyone traveled, hardly threw anything away, up until the current day times in the era of disposability, mobile phones, computers and all types of modern technology. It was really eye-opening, having the speed of how everything in our lives changed in a span of just about 70 years demonstrated in writing.
How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote.
p. 167-168
Nothing was thrown away. The contents of chamber pots were used for garden fertilizer, the dung of passing horses collected for potted plants. Newspaper was used for wrapping vegetables, drying shoes, wiping one's bottom in the lavatory.
p. 37
With digital technology, we drained reality dry.
p. 208
As much as there were parts that were very specific to the French society, there were just as many passages that universally applied. What it means to transition from being a girl, to a teenager, to a woman, the problems you face on the way, the reflections you might have and the transformations that you would go through as a person. All these found expression in ""The Years"" as well. The general idea of the book reminded me of Deborah Levy's autobiography trilogy, consisting of three books: ""Things I Don't Want to Know"" , ""The Cost of Living"" and ""Real Estate"" . Both women speak about what it means to be a writer, the discovery of one's own identity in solitude, going through divorce and life after it, as well as having children and seeing them grow up.
Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write 'a kind of woman's destiny', set between 1940 and 1985. It would be [...] a 'total novel' that would end with her dispossession of people and things: parents and husband, children who leave home, furniture that is sold.
p. 148
When she can't sleep at night, she tries to remember the details of all the rooms where she has slept: the one she shared with her parents until the age of thirteen, the ones at the university residence and the Annecy apartment facing the cemetery.
p. 166
I was extremely glad to have discovered the book and the author for the first time thanks to the ""Barcelona Women's Book Club"" . I felt like it would be an especially impactful read for women but even taken generally, it was an exceptional piece of writing. I would highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to reading further books by Annie Ernaux.

"Save something from the time where we will never be again. This was the final quote and I think the ultimate message of the book. I enjoyed reading it, the author's writing style is truly remarkable. The book had plenty very detailed references to French sociopolitical events of 21st century that an average non French reader would not know but that did not prevent me from enjoying every bit of it.","Arpi"
"We joked, “God is dead, Marx is dead, and I don’t feel so good either.” We had a sense of play.
Play is a good term. Ernaux is playing with memory. It is her story. She was born in France during the Second World War, as she recalls the hardships on her family, the rebuilding of the country and their zeal to forget what happened. She grows up, goes to college, becomes a teacher, talks about sex and abortion (told in another book), gets married, has children, gets disallusioned with marriage, it ends, starts life anew, has an affair with a younger man (another book too), retires and reflects on her life, her country and history. Sixty-five years.
It is also look back at the latter half of the twentieth century. It’s our collective history. May 1968, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 911 are landmarks. She covers themes like politics, sexual politics, war (there are a lot of them and how quickly we forget), and global events. Terrorism, racism, immigration, feminism, and religion. It reflects on how technology has changed us, slowly at first then it’s everywhere. It is a tale of us.
She speaks to us in third person and never singles herself out. It’s not really an autobiography but rather a recalling of life and events of this time. Her story is triggered by Ernaux looking at old photographs, Super 8 movies and videos. That is her play.
Buried in the book is the spark to write this book. What is the “Madeline” that trigger her to write this Proustian tale? Just as Proust reflected on his life, times, loves and events, Ernaux does the same (in much less pages).
It’s her life and our life all wrapped into one continuous story. Impersonal and yet oddly personal. Indelibly odd, beautiful and at times funny. How does our memory work on the past? Are these accurate and does it matter?
So many these events I could relate to which made me realize the common thread that binds us together. She is French and twenty years older than myself but her words triggered my own memories. Perhaps we humans are not as different as we think we are? What binds us together is more than what separates us.
Now I understand why she used the word “we” to describe her life. We really can’t separate ourselves from the world. Our world. Our past. The years.","David"
"Last year I had not heard of Annie Ernaux. Then I began to manage a new bookshop and we got in a range of books from independent publishers. I noticed that Fitzcarraldo seemed to be especially good and have a very high reputation. I had never read any of their books, despite having Second Hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich on my book shelves for years (I still haven't read it yet). Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk is one of our bestselling books, so I read that to see what the fuss was all about, and thought it was great. We were asked to host an event with Joshua Cohen for his book The Netenyahus, so we did, and I thought that novel was great, and it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize the next year. Then they asked if we would host an event for Daisy Hildyard for Emergency, so we did, and I thought it was another excellent novel. But we have more books by Annie Ernaux from Fitzcarraldo then any other writer, and she seems to have a fanbase that consists mostly of intelligent young women, so I picked up The Years a couple of months ago. Just as I decided it was time to read it Ernaux won the Nobel Prize.
This is the best Fitzcarraldo book I have read yet, and I think it's one of the best books of the 21st Century so far. It is a marvellous book, blending together autobiography, history and sociology in a very literary style. Ernaux reveals and crafts the sweep of her life, from being born into a relatively poor provincial family during WW2, through the social, political and material transformations that took place in French society in the decades that follow as she experiences the youth rebellion of the 50' and 60's, ascends into the bourgeoise, becomes a teacher, a wife and mother, experiences the revolutionary moment of May 68, and the political disappointment and cynicism that follows in the subsequent decades.
I cannot do the book justice with this description. I think it is one of the essential books of the 21st century. I can't think of a British writer operating at this level. And we should be very thankful to Fitzcarraldo for bringing the best literature in the world into being, and into English.","Darran Mclaughlin"
"Superb and highly original.
Besides being a pretty marvellous meditation on ageing and memory, this is such a simple (ha) and utterly sensible idea. Namely, that you are a product of your time, so what better way to write about a life than to retell it, overwhelmingly (but not exclusively), through the events and conventions of the age you lived through. It's so obvious that I can't believe it isn't seen more in fiction. And yes, that question: is it fiction (yes, surely). I love it how French lit keeps pushing the boundaries like this.
It's all rather moving and it's hard not to feel quite powerful empathy for the subject (I'd compare it a bit to 'The Up Series'). I for one found myself - dare I say it - feeling greater understanding of the Boomer generation (though actually these guys are older - they're more like Wartime Generation,,,though they were young in '68 too) and the cultural turns they experienced. By which I mean: growing up in a world where you had to get married to have sex and wearing lipstick was seen as whore-like...to letting your offspring have their their girlfriend stay over. No wonder they were a bit confused and contorted.
As the years a pass, ones own memories come into view...which, in a way, adds to the interest.
I'm not sure if this is Annie Ernaux's 'method', but it's very readable and makes for a kind of literary documentary. A sort of : this is what we were like. The only example in English of that voice I can remember is 'And Then We Came to the End' dealing in an entirely different realm. It works extremely well. As an observer of Francophonie and France in a permanent state of trying to catch up and fill in gaps, it's almost prefect reading for me. I hope the English version does well.
Oh by the way: the name of the pub in Finchley is the 'Tally Ho Corner'. I had to Google 'Telly O'Corner' to check if this was something she'd dreamed. It's a sweet example of bad-memory Chinese Whispers. Bravo.","Jake Goretzki"
"We are reading Annie Ernaux and we are very delighted. 'The Year's' promises an authorship that will enjoy us with more books with similar high class. We think it must be their best choice since Jose Saramago, in purely egoistic terms. We like it, that we understand, become engaged, enjoyed and feel as a part of even the literary world.
We sometimes have felt all stupid again, from choices we couldn't even understand. We felt it was too prudish at times. An ill smelling snobbery pricing literature for a tiny group of writers with a symbolism of no general availability for other cultures. We felt ashamed when Sweden, again, was priced. We felt cheated when our favourites never got it. They hate predictability, which is something we still, also, like about them. We don't like when they make statements though. Giving a brilliant singer, writing good local journalism this price we realise they are being unaware of biases and the effects on music to dope lyrics with qualities of moment. You don't have to keep the words moving with thinking, since music makes them seem alive in a not very magical way.
But only a week with the francophile choice of Annie Ernaux we are already very delighted. We got ourselves an author not unknown to focus on. We think of Ali Smith reading and are filled with joy, although it's less general (arguably), and packed with references only referring to France. We long to read another book by her, while still reading the first one. We don't forgive this noble institution but we know that people in power through all ages have tremendous collective disabilities in mentalisation. We are ourselves expressing views on topics without that much knowledge on them, or how they will be understood by others. And we are only one.","Anders Demitz-Helin"
"The Years is a slender book, but feels epic, spanning 70-years during the author's coming of age and life in France. While I can't deny that many of the major political events, figures, and movements felt foreign to me as an American, what makes The Years absorbing and unique is they way Ernaux captures a nation's feelings and experiences in relation to significant historic events, and renders them as universal. Through an inventive and original form of ""collective autobiography"" she presents, as she puts it, “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” It's a style that immediately sucks you in and makes you feel like an empathetic participant, even if you're an outsider.
For such an intellectual work, The Years could have been stuffy and impenetrable, but instead finds the right balance between niche, European, auto-fic and accessible, mainstream memoir. This is a book in which you can find the author's thoughts on French society, history, and politics bumping up against modern cultural touch-points like H&M shopping, mobile phones, the early internet, and Playstation. Add to that Ernaux's stunning prose and perceptive observations, and you have one of the smartest and most captivating non-fiction works of the year.
It's tough to pick a favorite passage, but one for me of many:
""The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""","Joe M"
"This book really grew on me as the narrative unfolded. The intertwining of personal and collective experience becomes more and more compelling. It is like an intimate memoir written by an entire generation. It is both touching and thought provoking.","Helen"
"Annie's diary covering the years from 1940 to 2006; roughly my peer. Although she talks about growing up and living in France, there are enough parallels between her life and mine as as American female as she watches and analyzes the decades morph and change. The world has changed dramatically from WWII until now, so I can relate to her observations.
“She often revisits images of herself single, in the streets of the cities where she has walked and in the rooms that she has occupied – in a young ladies’ hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair, or in a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The object of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: ‘Out of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not’”… pg 94
“She has lost her sense of the future, a kind of limitless background on which her actions and gestures were once projected, a waiting for all the good and unknown things that lived inside her…” pg 227","Candice"
"I read this novel right before Annie Ernaux was awarded with the Noble Prize, starting it for the second time, after having giving up a first time. Sadly, this novel was not for me. While this autobiography is very cleverly structured, it baffles me to see all the five-star reviews, as I think the text would only need interesting to the French.
To me, the whole book felt like a drawn-out conversation with a bourgeois Frenchman who wants to show how humanitarian he or she is and how everything he or she does is, in fact, done in solidarity with lower-class people. Showing solidarity is obviously not the problem, but rather the fact that this kind of people emphasize it so much, as if they want to get a medal for it.
Stylistically, I initially liked the vignettes about photographs Ernaux describes, but I quickly got tired of the fact that she simply swaps out ""je"" for ""nous"" to make her experiences universal. The meta chapter at the end (about writing this novel) was downright cheesy.","Lotte"
"I dnfed this book because although this was said to be translated, yet it still has a language barrier that I couldn't understand. To keep looking it up every few minutes was getting frustrating. I also did not like the way that this autobiography was written in individual sentence form or in very short paragraph form, it was confusing.
Sexual desire was compared to memories in the same breath as talking about grandparents and parents...bizarre. Things didn't seem to mesh well together or tie in well most of the time.
Some things that the author stated I didn't even understand such as , "" To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.""Huh?
Again, not sure if it a language barrier thing or the way it was written but I only made it a couple chapters before giving up. This is very rare for me , as you can see this is only my second dnf book out of almost 400. I did give this book to a friend, though, here's hoping that she enjoys it more!","Michelle"
"For a book that is pretty much an endless list of summarized French (and occasionally World) history, this just feels so empty. It’s sprawling time-wise for a memoir, but doesn’t go deep into anything mentioned. It’s basically a timeline of a woman’s life from 1941-2006 punctuated by both historical events and random life shit specific to Ernaux.
The parts about growing up as a French girl of her socio-economic status in the 40s-50s, and then experiencing the country transition to a more equal place for women had me interested. If this had a consistent feminist lens I imagine I would have enjoyed it more, but it really seems to lose its focus in the second 1/2, last 1/3rd especially, and seems to get more disjointed.
I’m sorry but I’d rather just read a history book and get a complete picture. To me, writing a book centered on memory and the passage of time is a worn-out concept. At least it’s a woman that’s doing it this time.
Also I don’t like her prose style.","Amelia"
"The Years by Annie Ernaux – it spans from Ernaux’s birth in 1940 to 2006. It is not a biography in a traditional sense as it is told as ‘we’ but Ernaux tells both her story and that of her generation. The book felt like a chronicle, record of facts, but I could feel Ernaux’s passion, somewhat disguised but yet coming through. I absolutely loved her references to writers, artists, politicians and I took note of many to learn more about them. Her language can feel raw at times and I like that too. That book is a keeper for me, I have it in Polish beautifully published by Czarne.

"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Memory, Time, Education Writing.
The four things that stood out to me very much in Annie Ernaux’s The Years— the winner of the Nobel prize in literature this year, 2022.
I picked this short book very randomly— I was bored with my other current reads and the Nobel prize was just announced around this time. Of a curiosity about why Annie Ernaux was chosen as the laureate, I picked up the book and am glad to say that now, I know why she won.
The Years was a beautiful, breathless piece of writing about time—-about Annie Ernaux but not limited to her own self. Honestly, it's much more fitting that this is an autobiography of a generation.
Taling or instead reminiscing the things that happened from the 1940s to 2007.
There is something nostalgic in Annie Ernaux’s way of laying moments in her life down in the book. I am not a french person yet reading what the french kids did way back in her childhood still gave me this feeling of nostalgia.
It's also fascinating to see the passage of time here— the narrator growing up from being a kid to a woman in her sixties. The historical event she experienced reminisced— all the wars, all the revolutions, the turn of the century; the feeling of transitioning from 1900 to 2000 and how underwhelming it is—it was like watching a life taking shape.
Annie Ernaux’s Prose too pioneered the greatness of the book. The content was already great, but Ernaux’s way of writing with such rawness and intimacy, and beauty elevated everything to heaven.
Aside from memory and time, Ernaux also wrote about her desire to write and what is education for her. The desire to study and write makes you want to change the world and cement yourself in history, which I could relate to heavily.
And there are also moments so raw that it felt invasive to read. It felt like I have read something from a diary that I was not supposed to see yet it captivated me because of its immense beauty and intimacy, which made me just emotional from reading it.
Quotes that resonated with me very much;
about memory:
Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual difference and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others.
Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation
about mother:
When it comes to her mother, she remembers the eyes, the hands, the silhouette; the voice, only in the abstract, without texture. The real voice is lost; she has no concrete remnant of it. But phrases often rise to her lips spontaneously, the same ones her mother used in the same contexts, expressions she didn’t remember ever using herself, “The weather is sluggish,” “He talked my ear off,” “You have to wait your turn, like at confession,” etc. It was if her mother were speaking through her mouth, and with her an entire lineage. Other phrases come into her head sometimes, the ones her mother used after she got Alzheimer’s. Their incongruity revealed her mother’s altered mental state, “You can bring me some rags to wipe my bottom with.” In a flash, her mother’s body and presence are returned to her. Unlike the former sentences, repeatedly used, the latter are unique, forever the preserve of one sole being in the world, her mother.
about Writing:
To see her in the photo, a handsome solid girl, one would never suspect that more than anything, she fears going mad. Only writing—or perhaps a man—can protect her from that, if only momentarily. She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.
About education:
It seems to her that education is more than just a way to escape poverty. It is a weapon of choice against stagnation in a kind of feminine condition that arouses her pity, the tendency to lose oneself in a man, which she has experienced (see the high school photo from five years before) and of which she is ashamed. She feels no desire to marry or have children. Mothering and the life of the mind seem incompatible. In any case, she’d be sure to be a bad mother. Her ideal is the union libre in the poem by André Breton. At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels “hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories,” that she is “looking for another language” and “longs to return to an original purity.” She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are “little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night.” Other sentences contradict this lassitude: “I am a will and a desire.” She does not say for what.
About aging:
She feels no age difference with women of forty-five or fifty, an illusion which the latter destroy in the course of conversation, without malice but implying that she doesn’t belong to the same generation as they, and is seen by them in the way she herself sees a woman of eighty, i.e., old. Unlike adolescence, when she was sure of not being the same from one year or even one month to the next, now she feels immutable in a world that moves ahead in leaps and bounds.","Ben Martizz"
"I can see why this book won a Nobel Prize. It captures the life of an unnamed woman from childhood to old age. It is done in a very readable way. I really enjoyed it.","Brie"
"Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it’s slipping by, but at the same time “progress” has landed us in a place we no longer recognize.
New York Times
I appreciated the history lesson and the honesty in this memoir. Many such essay collections become a laundry list of complaints but this memoir was diverse in topic and nuanced in explanation. It is a cruel irony that the bottle sitting by the sink that bleaches your hair to the shade of blond you wanted so badly is brought to you by the same corporations that you complain about pushing the latest toasters.","cycads and ferns"
"We had such a nice discussion of this memoir in our book club. I kind of let the details wash over me and didn't worry about things that were too French for me to understand. I appreciated the events she chose to highlight and the ones she left out (for example, an American memoirist of her era would certainly have addressed the Civil Rights Movement while I had to do some light research on Algeria which is clearly more important in France). Once we moved into events in my lifetime, I was even more engaged.","Andrea"
"All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.

"This book depicts and relies heavily on cultural and social references from its author’s French background, which often makes it indecipherable to the reader that is not familiar with this context.

Updated on 4/16/2018
My review originally published on LA Review of Books:
https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/t...
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"""There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and
'we', as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before...to save something from the
time we will never be again.""
A genre-bending masterpiece. History book, autobiography, novel (if all life is a fiction), exploration of memory. This isn't just Annie Ernaux's autobiography, it is also that of anyone who has lived in these times.
Making notes of what she remembers from 1941 to 2006, Ernaux never writes about the ""I"", it is always, ""she"", as if she stands outside of the life she has lived to reconstitute ""a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present.""
It is an unsentimental account that delves very rarely in the ""personal"" of Ernaux's life as if she was unable to separate the world from the individual. I found this a great relief.
Although her personal narrative takes place in France, the growing up and through global and common human events makes this book resonate on a very deep personal level.
Politics, revolution, sex, marriage, children, friendships, capitalism, the internet, you name it, Ernaux explores it with such incisive wisdom, it is hard to escape the times we have lived through and are living now.
Here she is in her sixties talking about her parenting of grown children:
""She continues to contribute to her children's material welfare to compensate for any pain they
might endure in their lives, for which she feels responsible, having brought them into the
world.""
The ""she"" is Ernaux but it is also me. As is the ""she"" in so much of this book.
About politics in the 2000s:
""We didn't quite know what was wearing us down the most, the media and their opinion polls,
'who do you trust', their condescending comments, the politicians with their promises to reduce
unemployment and plug the hole in the social security budget, or the escalator at the RER
station that was always out of order, the lines at Carrefour and the post office, all those things
that make it as futile to put a ballot in a ballot box as a contest entry form into a drum at the
shopping centre.""
Recognizable? Whatever country you live in, she captures the ""markers of an epoch.""
About the Internet:
""Talk to strangers, insult and chat them up, invent a self. They were disembodied, voiceless, devoid
of odour or gesture; they didn't get under our skin...We made our way around a world of objects
without subjects. The internet engineered the dazzling transformation of the world into discourse.
The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.""
Close to the beginning of this book, Ernaux writes what I perceived as her view of the ""self"" we all imagine ourselves to be and reading this paragraph gave me an inkling that in reading this book I would be embarking on an unusual but welcome journey with this author.
She writes:
""Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and
deathbed, eliminated. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will
continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing
but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant
generation.""
Well, that articulation just brought me joy.
Astonishing achievement. Highly recommended.","Wendy"
"This was an interesting read and a very interesting way to structure a nonfiction biographical story that skips through the time periods around world war 2 (i am not completely sure if it starts when the author herself was born 1940 or a little early or later? but around there) until 2016 (?).
it gives little snippets of insight into the historical moments, daily life and typical moments of the country during the times, reading almost like flipping through a photoalbum and getting little thoughts and memories of the person that put the album together.
it reminded me a bit if „Ducks, Newburyport“ in the way it was written (even though i am pretty sure this book „the years“ was written before the one i just mentioned but i read the other one before reading this one …) in that it felt as if we as the readers are getting the wandering thoughts of a person on topics -or in this books case specific times in history- but never to deep and in-depth but simple remembering something, shortly thinking about it before letting the mind wander on to the next topics.
i personally found that not the best style for a nonfiction work. if i get information about historical moments be it big evens or typical daily lives of everyday work people i want a bit more details. i want to be able to understand and feel and picture what is happening.
and sure in a way with this book and time time periods it talks about that is possible since most of us either have parents or grandparents that are in a similar age as the author and if you are European it’s very likely that -if the survived the ww2- they shared at least a little about the time around and/or after or what it was like growing up during a time directly after a horrendous war that left many places in europe in shambles.
also it is still pretty recent history and i would hope that most countries still teach the aftermaths of ww2.
what i mean with saying all that is that even without too many details a good of readers will understand most of what’s being said because in many cases it could connect with a personal story they have been told or something similar.
but is it really a good book and well written if it’s leans pretty heavily on the believe that the reader will have a basic understanding of those times in France and specifically Paris to fill in the missing pieces to make it all actually be meaningful?
clearly it is working since most other reviews i have seen so far from this book are highly rated and raving about how wonderful and even emotional this book and the reading experience was for them.
and i do understand how that could be that way…. but again maybe not necessarily because of how fantastic this book tells what it says but rather because the way it reminds readers of things?
and if that was the purpose?
well done!
but again i do not read autobiographical nonfictions to get snippets and skips through time that feel rather impersonal to the authors life.
i think this is a clear case of what you want from this type of book and how you will enjoy the writing style and what you want to read into the book.
if you want a clear cut nonfiction that just tells you the what and how? not the book for you!
if you want a book that is different and a bit strange not your typical nonfiction? go for it!","Dawnie"
"""We were mutating. We didn't know what our new shape would be. The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet towards other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
In THE YEARS, Annie Ernaux (as translated by Alison Strayer) explores the most personal features of memory, space, and time through the lens of history of not just France but of the whole world, a fitting proof that all life is political and that the political is personal.
The book is part memoir and part analysis of the ever changing society, marked by the products and pleasures people consume in different periods from 1941 to 2006. But I believe at the heart this is the realization that to understand oneself is to understand what’s happening around. The book is a contribution to the school of thought that a person is a product of multitudes of external factors, unconsciously or not. Personal narrative, as she said, is part of societal narrative.
Ernaux’s commentaries on society were flawlessly stitched into her personal memories of life growing up in France, leaving no feeling of being detached to the world. I love the honesty and the rawness of her prose and ideals, especially when she never shies away from admitting when she doesn’t understand things. It takes a certain level of confidence – or maybe more of certainty? – to be this honest in the face of neverending pressure from society.
I understand though that this book might not be for everyone. I struggled a bit going through some pages, especially as Ernaux tended to fixate on the most mundane yet still use the most complicated of sentences. But still there is something calming about THE YEARS. Maybe it’s the thought that time is a construct and we all have our expiration dates. That’s some comfort amid the chaos of life: “She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. But there is nothing.”","Jodesz Gavilan"
"""everything will be erased in a second. the dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. all there will be is silence and no words to say it. nothing will come out of the open mouth, I or me. language will continue to put the world into words. in conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
ernaux's musings on memory, mortality, the impermanence of the present moment, and the sentimentality of the passing of time are spectacular, made even more impressive by her unusual attempt to capture a collective rather than individual experience. most memoirs are trapped by the author's own subjectivity. ernaux recognizes this limitation, but also beautifully conveys the unity of experiencing a particular moment in time, blending personal anecdotes with history, descriptions of photos, niche cultural references, and generationally-specific slang. her reflections on the feminist movement and modernization are particularly fascinating, illuminating how such drastic changes were actually felt by those experiencing them through astute attention to seemingly trivial details.
while ""the years"" oftentimes frustrated me due to the narrator's distance, the idiosyncrasy of the narrative ultimately moved me in a way few memoirs have. i guess the impermanence of life has been weighing on me lately- even thinking back to four years ago, both I and the collective culture seem to have already changed so drastically, making the past heartbreakingly intangible. it's not that this nostalgia is justified, as I realize life wasn't actually any better then. it's just sad to me that I, and the world, will never feel that specific way again, and the ""feeling""of that moment in time feels impossible to really articulate to anyone but myself, trapped in my memory forever. reading ""the years"" didn't exactly quell these feelings, but somewhat validated them, and reaffirmed my need to at least try to be more present in the current moment","Lily"
"A fascinating book, a memoir told without the pronoun ""I,"" The Years takes us through the life of a woman and that of her generation. It gives you the sense of what the year 1955 was like, and 68 and 2000. The author will look at a photograph, describe its details very unemotionally, ""the girl"" ""she"", which we come to recognize is the author, recognize the dark hair--oh, here it is light brown! She must have dyed it--as the village girl becomes a young lady, a camp counselor, a student in her women's dormitory, her teaching career, marriage--we don't have her decisions and all the emotion that goes with that, just snatches of memory, a scene... the life of her body gets the most attention, her feelings about sex, masturbation, longing, fear of pregnancy, abortion, young mother... the most dispassionate divorce. The ""she"" is completely embodied within the ""we"", how we lived, what we thought, what was happening in society and how ""we"" felt about it.
I particularly marveled at the blurring between the individual and her generation, not something I think much about--the attempt to pin a texture to our journey through the years. There's a most interesting thread as the young girl sits through family dinners, what the adults talked about--then she is a young mother, and the table is hers--then she is the older mother, the grandmother, listening to grown children's concerns. ""We"" move through politics, move through fashions, move through technologies and fears, moments of high involvement and moments of stasis, as politicians and concerns come and go, rise and fall.
This was such a vibrant depiction of the border between the individual and history-- what it was like to be a young person in the '50s, a young middle aged woman in the '80s, what were people thinking and feeling in '68 who weren't on the barricades, how were they viewing their own times? It threw me into thinking about my own Years, how I would formulate a generational ""we"" of my own local experience. How I would view myself and my times through the lens of a crumpled photograph. Ernaux's memory is phenomenal, and ultimately that is what the book is about, to preserve a life, all these fragments that make up a life, embedded in one's times--to put words to this before it fades.
We don't know she's married, there's no romantic meals or courting--just this:
""Young couples with steady jobs opened bank accounts and took out Cofremca loans to acquire fridges with freezer compartments, dual-fuel ranges etc. The were surprised to discover that by the grace of marriage, they were poor in the face of all they lacked, the cost of which they never guessed, nor the necessity, which now went without saying. Overnight they became adults to whom parents could finally, without fear of rebuke, impart their knowledge of practicalities: saving money, caring for children, washing floors. How proud and peculiar one felt to be called ""Madame"" with a name not one's own....""","Janet"
"i am so glad i found this! it’s really difficult finding good books in english in bookstores here, i couldn’t believe it when i saw an annie ernaux book all by itself, like it was waiting for me! and to find it near the end of the year… it was perfect timing.
this book nearly brought me to tears multiple times. she writes about everything so gently, and so truthfully! the parts about the woman when she was in her twenties really, really shot through me. her life isn’t similar to mine, i’m not married, i’m not having kids any time soon, but i want to write too, and i fear what she fears, and what she fears comes true! this being a young girl and feeling as if it had been wasted and then becoming a young adult and feeling the weight of who you will become when you look at your mother and any older women, this metamorphosis from a girl to a ‘mother’, and when you are a mother you very nearly lose yourself! you feel guilty to let yourself think about yourself, write about yourself! it all hurt so badly to read. it reminded me of my mother of course and it expressed all i fear but hate to think about and express because it feels so disrespectful towards my mother and it feels dangerous to resist who i might become, because if i do become that, i might be even more miserable having previously resisted it. i’m just rambling. she says this all eloquently, with these beautiful pictures!
i cared little for the collective parts later in the book, when technology came in, and 9/11… it’s just old to me, but i know this book is written in a way that is very conscious of future readers, 2080 she says? or 2070? so they won’t feel the same. i don’t know i don’t have anything coherent to say having just finished it, and it really was a lot. i’ll go back to it often. it’s as hopeful as it is.. sad, i guess.","maya"
"It's a memoir, but more importantly, it is a memoir not just of an individual, but of a generation. Ernaux writes of the years between 1940 and 2007, attempting to ""capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"". She writes it in the voice of a generation - 'we', and describes herself in the third person - 'she'. And while we learn of her life - her childhood in the provinces, university, an illegal abortion, marriage, children, career, divorce, independence, writing, we also learn of a generation growing up post war, when war and death and the Church still loomed over the collective consciousness, when sex was taboo, a society of scarcity. Each subsequent decade comes with its individual and collective memory - university and the move away from home, clandestine sex, illegal abortions, Simone de Beauvoir, the Algerian war, the Cuban Missile crisis, the Vietnam war. And then marriage, and babies, and career, and supermarkets and domestic bliss but also Mitterrand and the vague feeling of having deviated from former goals, May '68 and revolution, the sexual revolution, women's lib, divorce, the walkman, consumerism. Soon enough there is Solzhenitsyn and the Gulags and the confusion of a generation bred on the dream of socialism, AIDS, waves of immigration, Le Pen. Suddenly revolution is a bad word, capitalism rules, the 'end of history' is proclaimed, Russia is nothing, there is Saddam Hussein and war again, and you are getting old, your children are all about the latest technology, sex has lost its ability to surprise, and the US is the power everyone looks up to, And so on and so forth until 2007, when she is officially retired and living an older woman's life. It is an education in French history through the second half of the 20th century, but it is also world history, so much of the twentieth century is 'globalised'.
It is an amazing way to write a memoir, and Ernaux holds me in her thrall through two hundred pages of taut prose, part sociology, part history, part memoir. It's Ernaux's attempt to 'save something from the time where we will never be again' and it truly is a wonderful attempt. I loved it.","Parvathy"
"Beautifully written, Ernaux's narrative highlights the profundity of the passage of time framed through the scope of both personal events/memories and the corresponding broad-strokes events of the time. Memories, people, minutiae and the specific written framing of all three aid in the creation of a truly moving work, one that serves to highlight the significance of life through the lens of time's movement.
Ernaux's insights throughout the piece are coupled with a wide array of specific moments, ones existing both outside the scope of her own personal life (politics and sociological/socioeconomic/sociopolitical/etc trends in particular) and through specific personal events themselves.
The way she manages to intertwine these moments alongside both retrospective insights and the sentiments she felt at the time allots the reader a sense of continuation in narrative form, while also providing both a profound degree of depth and a direct contextualization of the events that are occurring. This dichotomy of retrospective thought, coupled with her chronicling of the actual events themselves, allows for a deeply multifaceted presentation of both the events themselves and how their significance is viewed through two varying frameworks: the past and the present.
From the ending of WW2 to the invasion of Hungary in the 40s and 50s to the election of Sarkozy and the advent of the Wii in the mid-oughts, all enwoven with her family life, her thoughts on consumer society, death, and still a litany of other subjects, Ernaux's work, in large part facilitated by the lightness of her prose, succeeds in detailing the significance of the poignancy of the passage of time.

Winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize, and the perfect way to dive into Women in Translation month. This is my first Annie Ernaux, and apparently she is the voice of french women and I 100% believe that. ‘The Years’ is unlike anything I’ve ever read - we are not following the life of one author, but the life of the collective female consciousness through 60 years of French history.
Ernaux takes us on a roadtrip through the french obsession with sex - sexual desire, sexual liberation, depression because of/in spite of sexual liberation - labor movements, political upheavals, consumerism, communism, and seemingly most-importantly for everyone involved, the legalization of divorce.
She also pushes us to figure out what our generation’s unifying event is. For our great grandparents, at least in Europe and North America, it was WWII. For our grandparents, Vietnam. For our parents, 9/11. What’s ours? Or do we not get a unifying tragedy - are we just bleeding out, to steal a phrase from our generation’s greatest poet, Ms. Swift, from ”death by a thousand cuts?”
The translation by Alison Strayer from the original French is bril, but this is definitely a French book for French folks.

"A few passages from The Years:
Like sexual desire, memory never stops.
Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, “So that’s how it is – nothing will ever change.”
For the first time you could listen to music anywhere, whether one was lying on the beach with the radio next to one’s head, or walking down the street. The joy of the transistor was of an unknown species. One could be alone but not alone, and have at one’s command the noise and diversity of the world.
We were provided with sources of diversion, the Hula-Hoop and wholesome reading for young adults, but were not allowed to do anything that mattered, neither vote not make love, or even state an opinion. To have the right to be heard, one first had to prove one’s ability to blend in with the dominant social model…
We were expected to perpetuate tradition as a matter of course. In the face of this compulsory future, we vaguely yearned to stay young for a long, long time.
The thing most forbidden, the one we’d never believed possible, the contraceptive pill became legal. We didn’t dare ask the doctor for a prescription and the doctor didn’t offer, especially if one wasn’t married – that would be indecent. We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.

"4.5 stars, docked half a star for the fact it took me 7 months to get through and also because i just know it would hit different if i read it in french, but i also have no desire to do so
this was fabulous? there was a point where i thought i might give up on it, but i am so glad i persevered. like i know she won the nobel prize for literature and all but i wasn’t expecting it to feel so important. there’s an urgency about it, a desperation to record life as it has been lived that i think only comes after having lived for such a long time, and through so much. it was macro and micro, moments of huge social and worldwide consequence and moments of tiny insignificance that profoundly impact one’s life. it was snapshots and photographs and a real palimpsest of time that twists and folds over itself.
i loved how french it was, which sounds silly. and i loved its self-awareness. unraveling in the present tense with an awareness that it has already ended. i also loved the political side of it. the quote about how they believed they paved the way for political reform and revolution tickled me too…’we had the impression that all the world’s revolts and revolutions were our handiwork, from the eradication of slavery to the shipyards of Gdańsk and Tinananmen Swuare. There before us were all the peoples of the earth, every struggle of the past, present and future, all progeny of the French Revolution.’
‘Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been.’","meg fitzwater"
"“She will capture the lived dimension of history.”
I am left astounded at Annie Ernaux’s “The Years.” So much so that I struggle to find words to begin thinking about this kind of autobiography, if one were to call it that, or as she calls it, a “collective memory in an individual memory”, an attempt to skim the words off “the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope.”
I felt as though Ernaux were attempting to make a Proustian attempt at a written personal history, one that becomes an “instrument of struggle” to “capture the light that suffuses faces no longer seen and tables groaning with vanished food.” Unlike Proust, Ernaux performs this struggle with a collective in mind, as though all of France were reminiscing on the lost years, the years spanning from 1941 to 2006.
Details of everyday life, table conversations on politics and gossip, the genealogies of morality, the eternal transformation of juvenescence, reflections of life as a women in the progressions and regressions of western society, technological advances and the concomitant losses on the soul, patterns of war and strife—all of this and more are stationed as signposts through the constant passing of The Years. The loss of God, pupils carving into desks “God exists I stepped in it”, the sense of meaning post-1968 in Paris, the sense of play, the inception of globalized time, Auschwitz, September 11, Nintendo, the discourses of pleasure and shame, and the disappearance of all images. With all of these memories and their fading facial features, the only thing left to do is to write a story, in a culture with no patience for stories, a story of love, “a story of the time-before.”","Braden Matthew"
"a reimagining of the memoir in which one’s personal memory is inextricable from the collective experience of a place and time. once a moment is gone, it thereafter only survives in the memories of those who lived through it—how we collectively thought, spoke, and interacted with the world, which is constantly in flux. such experiences often feel nearly impossible to articulate—for most, there is a sense of insecurity speaking beyond the “I,” as most memoirs do, in favor of the “we,” as ernaux brilliantly manages to do here. I am still too young in many ways to be able to conceptualize these gradual changes as they are happening, but I wonder if the perpetual nostalgia I and many others have for the past extends beyond mere aesthetics, but a pondering of whether lived existence was truly different in an age of less technology, less questioning of tradition, less consumerism, less of the constant overstimulation that has long been inextricable from life as we know it. witnessing the last 80+ years of history through the eyes of a woman who has witnessed unimaginable amounts of social change leaves me with both an unshakeable sense of desolation for all that has been lost, yet a sense of comfort that there are humans who have been through all this before—and, in ernaux’s case, have the generosity to share their formidable knowledge. unlike anything I have read before, yet its universality and truth leaves me mystified as to how that can be true.","Abby"
"A truly fascinating book that resembles nothing I've read before. Ernaux is a master of l’écriture plate, with her simple, unadorned prose that is still strong enough to carry heavy themes, emotional baggage, and stylistic ingenuity. I felt that the translation was stunning-- Alison Strayer somehow managed to communicate the nuance of nous and on into English as Ernaux carefully sidesteps the autobiography of je.
I was also struck by the unusual format of the book, which felt both completely natural and brand new. Ernaux's life is peeled back in layers, each examined and analyzed by a detached, present-day narrator. Time collapses inward as Ernaux searches for clarity and finds none. Interspersed with her photographs of the past (described clinically, critically), Ernaux assumes the mantle of collective historian. She inventories life in mid- to late-20th-century France, sensitive to its political and social stirrings, tracking the rise of consumer capitalism and the cancerous growth of anti-immigrant and racist sentiments. I spent a lot of the book thinking about 1) how infrequently women are permitted to become ""the voice of a generation"" and document collective history, and 2) if there is an equivalent writer charting the decades in America, and if so, what would such a record look like?
Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by The Years and with Ernaux's writing. I truly look forward to reading more of her work.","Liz"
"3.33 stars. Like a very bleak (with the most neutral connotation) clam-chowder.
Bottom line: no one writes like Annie Ernaux does. The Years is simultaneously the pinnacle of a niche narrative and a Polaroid of the universal-ish experience amidst the rise of consumerism—captured from a unique vantage point at the verge of personal and collective history.
So much grace.

"Recently I’ve been thinking of shifting baselines and how quickly certain things become normalized not just through but even within generations (like how my parents are just as addicted to their phones as I am). This is something Ernaux manages to capture so well - the slow shift in perceptions, opinions and attitudes throughout time, to the point where we forget things were ever different, or maybe we can’t remember because we hadn’t been born yet. Things become normalised and are deemed ‘necessary’ not because they’re necessarily right but because we’re made to feel as if things have always been this way; and because we don’t know any different we don’t question these things. The Years was a helpful reminder for me that things were once different and therefore can be different again.
Such a privilege to be able to step into a time before mine, a time that belonged to my parents and grandparents, a time that I’ve only ever experienced through images but never as immersive and tactile as Annie Ernaux manages to capture it through her unique way of writing. I’m sure this is a book I will return to throughout my life and different parts will resonate as I age and go through the stages of life as Ernaux did.:)","Nicky"
"The descriptions for this book don't do justice to the work. It's always called a ""personal memoir"" told through ""memories of objects"", which is so elusive it doesn't really mean anything. So when I got it in a book subscription, I was disappointed; who wants to read about someone digging through her photo albums?
But The Years is so much more than it's made out to be. It's a personal memoir, but it's much more about the communities the narrator belongs to as she grows up. In this way, Ernaux tells a story that's less about herself and more about Lillebonne, where she grew up, and provincial France in general; Paris during the late 20th century; and her family and friends. The Years is best seen as an informal history of France from 1940 to 2007 where the narrator is something of a case study, a cross-section of the average French citizen. She, along with everyone in her age cohort, experiences France's post-war boom, the radical 1960s and the backlash 70s and 80s, the age-conscious 90s, the end-of-history turn of the millennium.
Ernaux is most effective when writing about the period after 1968. At the time, she was approaching 30, and her writing seems to age with her. It becomes less ecstatic, less political, as if the narrator has better things to worry about than who's in power at the moment. She is much more interested in her personal life, seeing as she has a personal life now, and is thinking about writing a novel (this one).
The Years is perfect. It's poetic and informative and makes you want to live a good life. It's a must-read for anyone of any age, whether to look forward, to reminisce, or to get you out of a slump in life. Ernaux seems to have a nugget of advice for readers of all ages.","Logan"
"It started in a strange way, it took time to get used to the numerous social and cultural references, which I did not get because I was not too familiar with France of the 40-50s but then it just became ingrained in my reading experience. It is a book about the reflection of society and its perks, the continuous circle of believing we are in a time and space that could be better while shaping our existence in what entails us at that exact time stamp. It was fabulous to read and feel the feelings of someone who lived through all these events, having a glimpse of the thoughts people had at the same time, something that is completely deleted in the historical Space.
It was beautifully written; the 3rd person allowed the author to expand her views and analyze what was going on from another person's perspective. You knew that the ""She"" was an ""I"" but that created a gloomy existence for the main character of an almost fictitious plot, which is often our reality through the eyes of the ""other"". I can see why she would receive the Nobel.","Francisco De Andrade Fernandes"
"Annie Ernaux‘s ‘Die Jahre’ is an incredible document of its and our time. Ernaux chronicles the life of a young woman (supposedly herself), structured by photographs of her growing from child, into teen, young woman, wife, (divorced) mother, grandmother, and everything in between. Through her life we get to live through a small portion of France’s history, spanning the post-war years up until and slightly beyond the turn of the 21st century. The text’s most striking quality lies in its ability to show the shifts in paradigms and the needed adaptability of the people living through these shifts. From political leadership, anti-war protests, women’s rights activism, to questions of motherhood, sexual freedom, and xenophobia, Ernaux talks us along through it all. While addressing huge topics from a small, individual standpoint, the narration never seems to claim an exhaustive picture of the times it describes. Beautifully, we see the world and it’s symptoms through the lens of the quotidian, the personal.","Nina"
"if i had three wishes from a genie, i think i would use at least one of them on being able to read books in their original language. i know i complain about this constantly but for ernaux it feels especially important. the translators note acknowledges the difficulty in capturing the author’s use of the ‘je collectif’ and its role in maintaining the rhythm of her writing. i would love to experience ‘the years’ as god intended.
once i got used to her style, i got completely immersed in this book and read it in one sitting (read: a 2.5 hour flight where my phone was on airplane mode). it’s not that the plot is particularly gripping or defined, but that i was eager to see how she would continue to weave the themes of time and memory into the narrative.
this memoir doesn’t feel personal, and yet it is highly specific. it is a catalogue of changing tastes and perceptions and the impact it has had on her (and women generally).
add this to your stack if you’re looking for something a little different. i have to say it was an excellent complement to fear of flying.
winter break is literally my super bowl so everyone buckle up; more reviews are coming.","Emma Santucci"
"Stunning. An extraordinarily vivid and riveting recreation of France - intensely personal, yet objective and communal - since Liberation: poverty, pride, provincialism, gentility, authoritarianism, dreams, religion, family, ambition, sex (wanting it, having it, ashamed of it, fearing it), families, literature, generations, class, sexism, war, atrocity, drugs, politics, fashion, snobbery, forgetting, paternalism, sunshine, holidays, film, music, rituals, outdoor privies and consumerism, time and memory - all accounted for in these literary flashes of experience - almost a stream of consciousness - in fact, an onrush of unstoppable consciousness, a flood of life.
This is history, time racing forward (to where?), a genre (if it is a genre) unlike any other, combining sociology, anthropology and 'auto-fiction' (whatever that is). At the outset the author creates a strong connection with the reader, who is helplessly caught up in the immense and fragmented narrative with a sense of instant recognition and almost overpowering feeling of empathy. Why does she do it? 'To save something from the time where we will never be again'. That sentence alone carries so much weight, so much pain, regret, sorrow, happiness. It's all about what it is to be human, I suppose - and it's quite brilliant.","John Fullerton"

My review originally published on LA Review of Books:
https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/t...
THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.
Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.
Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.
All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.
The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.
There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.
The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.
Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.
Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?
Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.
It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.
We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.
Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.
Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.
Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.
Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Azarin"
"""There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and
'we', as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before...to save something from the
time we will never be again.""
A genre-bending masterpiece. History book, autobiography, novel (if all life is a fiction), exploration of memory. This isn't just Annie Ernaux's autobiography, it is also that of anyone who has lived in these times.
Making notes of what she remembers from 1941 to 2006, Ernaux never writes about the ""I"", it is always, ""she"", as if she stands outside of the life she has lived to reconstitute ""a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present.""
It is an unsentimental account that delves very rarely in the ""personal"" of Ernaux's life as if she was unable to separate the world from the individual. I found this a great relief.
Although her personal narrative takes place in France, the growing up and through global and common human events makes this book resonate on a very deep personal level.
Politics, revolution, sex, marriage, children, friendships, capitalism, the internet, you name it, Ernaux explores it with such incisive wisdom, it is hard to escape the times we have lived through and are living now.
Here she is in her sixties talking about her parenting of grown children:
""She continues to contribute to her children's material welfare to compensate for any pain they
might endure in their lives, for which she feels responsible, having brought them into the
world.""
The ""she"" is Ernaux but it is also me. As is the ""she"" in so much of this book.
About politics in the 2000s:
""We didn't quite know what was wearing us down the most, the media and their opinion polls,
'who do you trust', their condescending comments, the politicians with their promises to reduce
unemployment and plug the hole in the social security budget, or the escalator at the RER
station that was always out of order, the lines at Carrefour and the post office, all those things
that make it as futile to put a ballot in a ballot box as a contest entry form into a drum at the
shopping centre.""
Recognizable? Whatever country you live in, she captures the ""markers of an epoch.""
About the Internet:
""Talk to strangers, insult and chat them up, invent a self. They were disembodied, voiceless, devoid
of odour or gesture; they didn't get under our skin...We made our way around a world of objects
without subjects. The internet engineered the dazzling transformation of the world into discourse.
The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time.""
Close to the beginning of this book, Ernaux writes what I perceived as her view of the ""self"" we all imagine ourselves to be and reading this paragraph gave me an inkling that in reading this book I would be embarking on an unusual but welcome journey with this author.
She writes:
""Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and
deathbed, eliminated. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will
continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing
but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant
generation.""
Well, that articulation just brought me joy.
Astonishing achievement. Highly recommended.","Wendy"
"This was an interesting read and a very interesting way to structure a nonfiction biographical story that skips through the time periods around world war 2 (i am not completely sure if it starts when the author herself was born 1940 or a little early or later? but around there) until 2016 (?).
it gives little snippets of insight into the historical moments, daily life and typical moments of the country during the times, reading almost like flipping through a photoalbum and getting little thoughts and memories of the person that put the album together.
it reminded me a bit if „Ducks, Newburyport“ in the way it was written (even though i am pretty sure this book „the years“ was written before the one i just mentioned but i read the other one before reading this one …) in that it felt as if we as the readers are getting the wandering thoughts of a person on topics -or in this books case specific times in history- but never to deep and in-depth but simple remembering something, shortly thinking about it before letting the mind wander on to the next topics.
i personally found that not the best style for a nonfiction work. if i get information about historical moments be it big evens or typical daily lives of everyday work people i want a bit more details. i want to be able to understand and feel and picture what is happening.
and sure in a way with this book and time time periods it talks about that is possible since most of us either have parents or grandparents that are in a similar age as the author and if you are European it’s very likely that -if the survived the ww2- they shared at least a little about the time around and/or after or what it was like growing up during a time directly after a horrendous war that left many places in europe in shambles.
also it is still pretty recent history and i would hope that most countries still teach the aftermaths of ww2.
what i mean with saying all that is that even without too many details a good of readers will understand most of what’s being said because in many cases it could connect with a personal story they have been told or something similar.
but is it really a good book and well written if it’s leans pretty heavily on the believe that the reader will have a basic understanding of those times in France and specifically Paris to fill in the missing pieces to make it all actually be meaningful?
clearly it is working since most other reviews i have seen so far from this book are highly rated and raving about how wonderful and even emotional this book and the reading experience was for them.
and i do understand how that could be that way…. but again maybe not necessarily because of how fantastic this book tells what it says but rather because the way it reminds readers of things?
and if that was the purpose?
well done!
but again i do not read autobiographical nonfictions to get snippets and skips through time that feel rather impersonal to the authors life.
i think this is a clear case of what you want from this type of book and how you will enjoy the writing style and what you want to read into the book.
if you want a clear cut nonfiction that just tells you the what and how? not the book for you!
if you want a book that is different and a bit strange not your typical nonfiction? go for it!","Dawnie"
"""We were mutating. We didn't know what our new shape would be. The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet towards other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.""
In THE YEARS, Annie Ernaux (as translated by Alison Strayer) explores the most personal features of memory, space, and time through the lens of history of not just France but of the whole world, a fitting proof that all life is political and that the political is personal.
The book is part memoir and part analysis of the ever changing society, marked by the products and pleasures people consume in different periods from 1941 to 2006. But I believe at the heart this is the realization that to understand oneself is to understand what’s happening around. The book is a contribution to the school of thought that a person is a product of multitudes of external factors, unconsciously or not. Personal narrative, as she said, is part of societal narrative.
Ernaux’s commentaries on society were flawlessly stitched into her personal memories of life growing up in France, leaving no feeling of being detached to the world. I love the honesty and the rawness of her prose and ideals, especially when she never shies away from admitting when she doesn’t understand things. It takes a certain level of confidence – or maybe more of certainty? – to be this honest in the face of neverending pressure from society.
I understand though that this book might not be for everyone. I struggled a bit going through some pages, especially as Ernaux tended to fixate on the most mundane yet still use the most complicated of sentences. But still there is something calming about THE YEARS. Maybe it’s the thought that time is a construct and we all have our expiration dates. That’s some comfort amid the chaos of life: “She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. But there is nothing.”","Jodesz Gavilan"
"""everything will be erased in a second. the dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. all there will be is silence and no words to say it. nothing will come out of the open mouth, I or me. language will continue to put the world into words. in conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.""
ernaux's musings on memory, mortality, the impermanence of the present moment, and the sentimentality of the passing of time are spectacular, made even more impressive by her unusual attempt to capture a collective rather than individual experience. most memoirs are trapped by the author's own subjectivity. ernaux recognizes this limitation, but also beautifully conveys the unity of experiencing a particular moment in time, blending personal anecdotes with history, descriptions of photos, niche cultural references, and generationally-specific slang. her reflections on the feminist movement and modernization are particularly fascinating, illuminating how such drastic changes were actually felt by those experiencing them through astute attention to seemingly trivial details.
while ""the years"" oftentimes frustrated me due to the narrator's distance, the idiosyncrasy of the narrative ultimately moved me in a way few memoirs have. i guess the impermanence of life has been weighing on me lately- even thinking back to four years ago, both I and the collective culture seem to have already changed so drastically, making the past heartbreakingly intangible. it's not that this nostalgia is justified, as I realize life wasn't actually any better then. it's just sad to me that I, and the world, will never feel that specific way again, and the ""feeling""of that moment in time feels impossible to really articulate to anyone but myself, trapped in my memory forever. reading ""the years"" didn't exactly quell these feelings, but somewhat validated them, and reaffirmed my need to at least try to be more present in the current moment","Lily"
"A fascinating book, a memoir told without the pronoun ""I,"" The Years takes us through the life of a woman and that of her generation. It gives you the sense of what the year 1955 was like, and 68 and 2000. The author will look at a photograph, describe its details very unemotionally, ""the girl"" ""she"", which we come to recognize is the author, recognize the dark hair--oh, here it is light brown! She must have dyed it--as the village girl becomes a young lady, a camp counselor, a student in her women's dormitory, her teaching career, marriage--we don't have her decisions and all the emotion that goes with that, just snatches of memory, a scene... the life of her body gets the most attention, her feelings about sex, masturbation, longing, fear of pregnancy, abortion, young mother... the most dispassionate divorce. The ""she"" is completely embodied within the ""we"", how we lived, what we thought, what was happening in society and how ""we"" felt about it.
I particularly marveled at the blurring between the individual and her generation, not something I think much about--the attempt to pin a texture to our journey through the years. There's a most interesting thread as the young girl sits through family dinners, what the adults talked about--then she is a young mother, and the table is hers--then she is the older mother, the grandmother, listening to grown children's concerns. ""We"" move through politics, move through fashions, move through technologies and fears, moments of high involvement and moments of stasis, as politicians and concerns come and go, rise and fall.
This was such a vibrant depiction of the border between the individual and history-- what it was like to be a young person in the '50s, a young middle aged woman in the '80s, what were people thinking and feeling in '68 who weren't on the barricades, how were they viewing their own times? It threw me into thinking about my own Years, how I would formulate a generational ""we"" of my own local experience. How I would view myself and my times through the lens of a crumpled photograph. Ernaux's memory is phenomenal, and ultimately that is what the book is about, to preserve a life, all these fragments that make up a life, embedded in one's times--to put words to this before it fades.
We don't know she's married, there's no romantic meals or courting--just this:
""Young couples with steady jobs opened bank accounts and took out Cofremca loans to acquire fridges with freezer compartments, dual-fuel ranges etc. The were surprised to discover that by the grace of marriage, they were poor in the face of all they lacked, the cost of which they never guessed, nor the necessity, which now went without saying. Overnight they became adults to whom parents could finally, without fear of rebuke, impart their knowledge of practicalities: saving money, caring for children, washing floors. How proud and peculiar one felt to be called ""Madame"" with a name not one's own....""","Janet"
"i am so glad i found this! it’s really difficult finding good books in english in bookstores here, i couldn’t believe it when i saw an annie ernaux book all by itself, like it was waiting for me! and to find it near the end of the year… it was perfect timing.
this book nearly brought me to tears multiple times. she writes about everything so gently, and so truthfully! the parts about the woman when she was in her twenties really, really shot through me. her life isn’t similar to mine, i’m not married, i’m not having kids any time soon, but i want to write too, and i fear what she fears, and what she fears comes true! this being a young girl and feeling as if it had been wasted and then becoming a young adult and feeling the weight of who you will become when you look at your mother and any older women, this metamorphosis from a girl to a ‘mother’, and when you are a mother you very nearly lose yourself! you feel guilty to let yourself think about yourself, write about yourself! it all hurt so badly to read. it reminded me of my mother of course and it expressed all i fear but hate to think about and express because it feels so disrespectful towards my mother and it feels dangerous to resist who i might become, because if i do become that, i might be even more miserable having previously resisted it. i’m just rambling. she says this all eloquently, with these beautiful pictures!
i cared little for the collective parts later in the book, when technology came in, and 9/11… it’s just old to me, but i know this book is written in a way that is very conscious of future readers, 2080 she says? or 2070? so they won’t feel the same. i don’t know i don’t have anything coherent to say having just finished it, and it really was a lot. i’ll go back to it often. it’s as hopeful as it is.. sad, i guess.","maya"
"It's a memoir, but more importantly, it is a memoir not just of an individual, but of a generation. Ernaux writes of the years between 1940 and 2007, attempting to ""capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory"". She writes it in the voice of a generation - 'we', and describes herself in the third person - 'she'. And while we learn of her life - her childhood in the provinces, university, an illegal abortion, marriage, children, career, divorce, independence, writing, we also learn of a generation growing up post war, when war and death and the Church still loomed over the collective consciousness, when sex was taboo, a society of scarcity. Each subsequent decade comes with its individual and collective memory - university and the move away from home, clandestine sex, illegal abortions, Simone de Beauvoir, the Algerian war, the Cuban Missile crisis, the Vietnam war. And then marriage, and babies, and career, and supermarkets and domestic bliss but also Mitterrand and the vague feeling of having deviated from former goals, May '68 and revolution, the sexual revolution, women's lib, divorce, the walkman, consumerism. Soon enough there is Solzhenitsyn and the Gulags and the confusion of a generation bred on the dream of socialism, AIDS, waves of immigration, Le Pen. Suddenly revolution is a bad word, capitalism rules, the 'end of history' is proclaimed, Russia is nothing, there is Saddam Hussein and war again, and you are getting old, your children are all about the latest technology, sex has lost its ability to surprise, and the US is the power everyone looks up to, And so on and so forth until 2007, when she is officially retired and living an older woman's life. It is an education in French history through the second half of the 20th century, but it is also world history, so much of the twentieth century is 'globalised'.
It is an amazing way to write a memoir, and Ernaux holds me in her thrall through two hundred pages of taut prose, part sociology, part history, part memoir. It's Ernaux's attempt to 'save something from the time where we will never be again' and it truly is a wonderful attempt. I loved it.","Parvathy"
"Beautifully written, Ernaux's narrative highlights the profundity of the passage of time framed through the scope of both personal events/memories and the corresponding broad-strokes events of the time. Memories, people, minutiae and the specific written framing of all three aid in the creation of a truly moving work, one that serves to highlight the significance of life through the lens of time's movement.
Ernaux's insights throughout the piece are coupled with a wide array of specific moments, ones existing both outside the scope of her own personal life (politics and sociological/socioeconomic/sociopolitical/etc trends in particular) and through specific personal events themselves.
The way she manages to intertwine these moments alongside both retrospective insights and the sentiments she felt at the time allots the reader a sense of continuation in narrative form, while also providing both a profound degree of depth and a direct contextualization of the events that are occurring. This dichotomy of retrospective thought, coupled with her chronicling of the actual events themselves, allows for a deeply multifaceted presentation of both the events themselves and how their significance is viewed through two varying frameworks: the past and the present.
From the ending of WW2 to the invasion of Hungary in the 40s and 50s to the election of Sarkozy and the advent of the Wii in the mid-oughts, all enwoven with her family life, her thoughts on consumer society, death, and still a litany of other subjects, Ernaux's work, in large part facilitated by the lightness of her prose, succeeds in detailing the significance of the poignancy of the passage of time.
'Save something from the time where we will never be again'","John"

Ernaux takes us on a roadtrip through the french obsession with sex - sexual desire, sexual liberation, depression because of/in spite of sexual liberation - labor movements, political upheavals, consumerism, communism, and seemingly most-importantly for everyone involved, the legalization of divorce.
She also pushes us to figure out what our generation’s unifying event is. For our great grandparents, at least in Europe and North America, it was WWII. For our grandparents, Vietnam. For our parents, 9/11. What’s ours? Or do we not get a unifying tragedy - are we just bleeding out, to steal a phrase from our generation’s greatest poet, Ms. Swift, from ”death by a thousand cuts?”
The translation by Alison Strayer from the original French is bril, but this is definitely a French book for French folks. Almost like if someone from Croatia tried to read through 60 successive years of Dave Barry’s “Year in Review.” 5 stars for execution, but 3 stars for my personal reading experience.","Shelby Thompson"
"A few passages from The Years:
Like sexual desire, memory never stops.
Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, “So that’s how it is – nothing will ever change.”
For the first time you could listen to music anywhere, whether one was lying on the beach with the radio next to one’s head, or walking down the street. The joy of the transistor was of an unknown species. One could be alone but not alone, and have at one’s command the noise and diversity of the world.
We were provided with sources of diversion, the Hula-Hoop and wholesome reading for young adults, but were not allowed to do anything that mattered, neither vote not make love, or even state an opinion. To have the right to be heard, one first had to prove one’s ability to blend in with the dominant social model…
We were expected to perpetuate tradition as a matter of course. In the face of this compulsory future, we vaguely yearned to stay young for a long, long time.
The thing most forbidden, the one we’d never believed possible, the contraceptive pill became legal. We didn’t dare ask the doctor for a prescription and the doctor didn’t offer, especially if one wasn’t married – that would be indecent. We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.
It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, devouring the present as it goes…","Jacob Wren"
"4.5 stars, docked half a star for the fact it took me 7 months to get through and also because i just know it would hit different if i read it in french, but i also have no desire to do so
this was fabulous? there was a point where i thought i might give up on it, but i am so glad i persevered. like i know she won the nobel prize for literature and all but i wasn’t expecting it to feel so important. there’s an urgency about it, a desperation to record life as it has been lived that i think only comes after having lived for such a long time, and through so much. it was macro and micro, moments of huge social and worldwide consequence and moments of tiny insignificance that profoundly impact one’s life. it was snapshots and photographs and a real palimpsest of time that twists and folds over itself.
i loved how french it was, which sounds silly. and i loved its self-awareness. unraveling in the present tense with an awareness that it has already ended. i also loved the political side of it. the quote about how they believed they paved the way for political reform and revolution tickled me too…’we had the impression that all the world’s revolts and revolutions were our handiwork, from the eradication of slavery to the shipyards of Gdańsk and Tinananmen Swuare. There before us were all the peoples of the earth, every struggle of the past, present and future, all progeny of the French Revolution.’
‘Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been.’","meg fitzwater"
"“She will capture the lived dimension of history.”
I am left astounded at Annie Ernaux’s “The Years.” So much so that I struggle to find words to begin thinking about this kind of autobiography, if one were to call it that, or as she calls it, a “collective memory in an individual memory”, an attempt to skim the words off “the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope.”
I felt as though Ernaux were attempting to make a Proustian attempt at a written personal history, one that becomes an “instrument of struggle” to “capture the light that suffuses faces no longer seen and tables groaning with vanished food.” Unlike Proust, Ernaux performs this struggle with a collective in mind, as though all of France were reminiscing on the lost years, the years spanning from 1941 to 2006.
Details of everyday life, table conversations on politics and gossip, the genealogies of morality, the eternal transformation of juvenescence, reflections of life as a women in the progressions and regressions of western society, technological advances and the concomitant losses on the soul, patterns of war and strife—all of this and more are stationed as signposts through the constant passing of The Years. The loss of God, pupils carving into desks “God exists I stepped in it”, the sense of meaning post-1968 in Paris, the sense of play, the inception of globalized time, Auschwitz, September 11, Nintendo, the discourses of pleasure and shame, and the disappearance of all images. With all of these memories and their fading facial features, the only thing left to do is to write a story, in a culture with no patience for stories, a story of love, “a story of the time-before.”","Braden Matthew"
"a reimagining of the memoir in which one’s personal memory is inextricable from the collective experience of a place and time. once a moment is gone, it thereafter only survives in the memories of those who lived through it—how we collectively thought, spoke, and interacted with the world, which is constantly in flux. such experiences often feel nearly impossible to articulate—for most, there is a sense of insecurity speaking beyond the “I,” as most memoirs do, in favor of the “we,” as ernaux brilliantly manages to do here. I am still too young in many ways to be able to conceptualize these gradual changes as they are happening, but I wonder if the perpetual nostalgia I and many others have for the past extends beyond mere aesthetics, but a pondering of whether lived existence was truly different in an age of less technology, less questioning of tradition, less consumerism, less of the constant overstimulation that has long been inextricable from life as we know it. witnessing the last 80+ years of history through the eyes of a woman who has witnessed unimaginable amounts of social change leaves me with both an unshakeable sense of desolation for all that has been lost, yet a sense of comfort that there are humans who have been through all this before—and, in ernaux’s case, have the generosity to share their formidable knowledge. unlike anything I have read before, yet its universality and truth leaves me mystified as to how that can be true.","Abby"
"A truly fascinating book that resembles nothing I've read before. Ernaux is a master of l’écriture plate, with her simple, unadorned prose that is still strong enough to carry heavy themes, emotional baggage, and stylistic ingenuity. I felt that the translation was stunning-- Alison Strayer somehow managed to communicate the nuance of nous and on into English as Ernaux carefully sidesteps the autobiography of je.
I was also struck by the unusual format of the book, which felt both completely natural and brand new. Ernaux's life is peeled back in layers, each examined and analyzed by a detached, present-day narrator. Time collapses inward as Ernaux searches for clarity and finds none. Interspersed with her photographs of the past (described clinically, critically), Ernaux assumes the mantle of collective historian. She inventories life in mid- to late-20th-century France, sensitive to its political and social stirrings, tracking the rise of consumer capitalism and the cancerous growth of anti-immigrant and racist sentiments. I spent a lot of the book thinking about 1) how infrequently women are permitted to become ""the voice of a generation"" and document collective history, and 2) if there is an equivalent writer charting the decades in America, and if so, what would such a record look like?
Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by The Years and with Ernaux's writing. I truly look forward to reading more of her work.","Liz"
"3.33 stars. Like a very bleak (with the most neutral connotation) clam-chowder.
Bottom line: no one writes like Annie Ernaux does. The Years is simultaneously the pinnacle of a niche narrative and a Polaroid of the universal-ish experience amidst the rise of consumerism—captured from a unique vantage point at the verge of personal and collective history.
So much grace.

“She has gone over to the other side but she cannot say of what … ‘I am a will and a desire.’ She does not say for what.”
“Real thoughts plumb the depths of transient sensations, impossible to communicate.”
“We remembered our parents’ reproach, ‘Be happy with what you've got!’ Now we knew that all we had didn't add up to happiness, but that was no reason to abandon things.”
“There were too many images for us to stop at each and recall the circumstances in which they were taken.
Inside them, we lived a near weightless, transfigured existence. The signs of our existence multiplied and put an end to the sensation of time marching on.”
“We were mutating. We didn't know what our new shape would be.”
“By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History … To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.”
“To save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Ziyan"
"Recently I’ve been thinking of shifting baselines and how quickly certain things become normalized not just through but even within generations (like how my parents are just as addicted to their phones as I am). This is something Ernaux manages to capture so well - the slow shift in perceptions, opinions and attitudes throughout time, to the point where we forget things were ever different, or maybe we can’t remember because we hadn’t been born yet. Things become normalised and are deemed ‘necessary’ not because they’re necessarily right but because we’re made to feel as if things have always been this way; and because we don’t know any different we don’t question these things. The Years was a helpful reminder for me that things were once different and therefore can be different again.
Such a privilege to be able to step into a time before mine, a time that belonged to my parents and grandparents, a time that I’ve only ever experienced through images but never as immersive and tactile as Annie Ernaux manages to capture it through her unique way of writing. I’m sure this is a book I will return to throughout my life and different parts will resonate as I age and go through the stages of life as Ernaux did.:)","Nicky"
"The descriptions for this book don't do justice to the work. It's always called a ""personal memoir"" told through ""memories of objects"", which is so elusive it doesn't really mean anything. So when I got it in a book subscription, I was disappointed; who wants to read about someone digging through her photo albums?
But The Years is so much more than it's made out to be. It's a personal memoir, but it's much more about the communities the narrator belongs to as she grows up. In this way, Ernaux tells a story that's less about herself and more about Lillebonne, where she grew up, and provincial France in general; Paris during the late 20th century; and her family and friends. The Years is best seen as an informal history of France from 1940 to 2007 where the narrator is something of a case study, a cross-section of the average French citizen. She, along with everyone in her age cohort, experiences France's post-war boom, the radical 1960s and the backlash 70s and 80s, the age-conscious 90s, the end-of-history turn of the millennium.
Ernaux is most effective when writing about the period after 1968. At the time, she was approaching 30, and her writing seems to age with her. It becomes less ecstatic, less political, as if the narrator has better things to worry about than who's in power at the moment. She is much more interested in her personal life, seeing as she has a personal life now, and is thinking about writing a novel (this one).
The Years is perfect. It's poetic and informative and makes you want to live a good life. It's a must-read for anyone of any age, whether to look forward, to reminisce, or to get you out of a slump in life. Ernaux seems to have a nugget of advice for readers of all ages.","Logan"
"It started in a strange way, it took time to get used to the numerous social and cultural references, which I did not get because I was not too familiar with France of the 40-50s but then it just became ingrained in my reading experience. It is a book about the reflection of society and its perks, the continuous circle of believing we are in a time and space that could be better while shaping our existence in what entails us at that exact time stamp. It was fabulous to read and feel the feelings of someone who lived through all these events, having a glimpse of the thoughts people had at the same time, something that is completely deleted in the historical Space.
It was beautifully written; the 3rd person allowed the author to expand her views and analyze what was going on from another person's perspective. You knew that the ""She"" was an ""I"" but that created a gloomy existence for the main character of an almost fictitious plot, which is often our reality through the eyes of the ""other"". I can see why she would receive the Nobel.","Francisco De Andrade Fernandes"
"Annie Ernaux‘s ‘Die Jahre’ is an incredible document of its and our time. Ernaux chronicles the life of a young woman (supposedly herself), structured by photographs of her growing from child, into teen, young woman, wife, (divorced) mother, grandmother, and everything in between. Through her life we get to live through a small portion of France’s history, spanning the post-war years up until and slightly beyond the turn of the 21st century. The text’s most striking quality lies in its ability to show the shifts in paradigms and the needed adaptability of the people living through these shifts. From political leadership, anti-war protests, women’s rights activism, to questions of motherhood, sexual freedom, and xenophobia, Ernaux talks us along through it all. While addressing huge topics from a small, individual standpoint, the narration never seems to claim an exhaustive picture of the times it describes. Beautifully, we see the world and it’s symptoms through the lens of the quotidian, the personal.","Nina"
"if i had three wishes from a genie, i think i would use at least one of them on being able to read books in their original language. i know i complain about this constantly but for ernaux it feels especially important. the translators note acknowledges the difficulty in capturing the author’s use of the ‘je collectif’ and its role in maintaining the rhythm of her writing. i would love to experience ‘the years’ as god intended.
once i got used to her style, i got completely immersed in this book and read it in one sitting (read: a 2.5 hour flight where my phone was on airplane mode). it’s not that the plot is particularly gripping or defined, but that i was eager to see how she would continue to weave the themes of time and memory into the narrative.
this memoir doesn’t feel personal, and yet it is highly specific. it is a catalogue of changing tastes and perceptions and the impact it has had on her (and women generally).
add this to your stack if you’re looking for something a little different. i have to say it was an excellent complement to fear of flying.
winter break is literally my super bowl so everyone buckle up; more reviews are coming.","Emma Santucci"
"Stunning. An extraordinarily vivid and riveting recreation of France - intensely personal, yet objective and communal - since Liberation: poverty, pride, provincialism, gentility, authoritarianism, dreams, religion, family, ambition, sex (wanting it, having it, ashamed of it, fearing it), families, literature, generations, class, sexism, war, atrocity, drugs, politics, fashion, snobbery, forgetting, paternalism, sunshine, holidays, film, music, rituals, outdoor privies and consumerism, time and memory - all accounted for in these literary flashes of experience - almost a stream of consciousness - in fact, an onrush of unstoppable consciousness, a flood of life.
This is history, time racing forward (to where?), a genre (if it is a genre) unlike any other, combining sociology, anthropology and 'auto-fiction' (whatever that is). At the outset the author creates a strong connection with the reader, who is helplessly caught up in the immense and fragmented narrative with a sense of instant recognition and almost overpowering feeling of empathy. Why does she do it? 'To save something from the time where we will never be again'. That sentence alone carries so much weight, so much pain, regret, sorrow, happiness. It's all about what it is to be human, I suppose - and it's quite brilliant.","John Fullerton"
