"« Il n'y a point d'âge légal pour le malheur. » (There Is No legal age for misfortune).
Indeed, Chateaubriand's life was almost romantic, tragic, terrible and fantastic. I see his memoirs like a confrontation between a dying old order (the aristocrats, the old French regime – Chateaubriand belongs to them) and a “new“order, modern, born of the Revolution. His memoirs cast another glance at the nineteenth-century birth. While Saint-Simon and then Auguste Comte are in the process of founding a religion of progress of mankind toward a future full of happiness; Chateaubriand sees this like an utopia and death through his testimony. A great reading. Far more enjoyable than Les Confessions of Rousseau.",Licinius

It really is not my cup of tea, at all. It was so boring to me, and put me in a reading slump...",Valentine
"sad story but i like it the first part of these memoirs traversed by history, where the melancholy words hard to believe in the reality of the world, where the vanity of things always shines, is the most personal. Because the writer does not only tells them what he called his first career soldier and traveler, but the beginning of a life that is revealed to us as a story of training: the young Breton knight soon left for America and the aristocrat who fought in the army of the Princes, emigrated to England, before returning to France to become Chateaubriand.",Hicham
Another piece of cake. Took the time for reading it.,Stef Onthesea
