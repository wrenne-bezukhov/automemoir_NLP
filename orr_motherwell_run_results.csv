"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"
"Any book that mentions Hamish Imlach must be worth 5 stars. Seriously though worth a read.","David Hill"
"3.5 rounded to 4*","Kirsten Mackie"
"I loved the social history and it was a real trip down memory lane for me as we are the same age but I didn’t really like her!","Jacqueline Piper"
"I really enjoyed lots of aspects of this book. The history of the area; impact of war on her parents. It’s is well written and an interesting way to construct a memoir.","Sarah Wheatley"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"
"Any book that mentions Hamish Imlach must be worth 5 stars. Seriously though worth a read.","David Hill"
"3.5 rounded to 4*","Kirsten Mackie"
"I loved the social history and it was a real trip down memory lane for me as we are the same age but I didn’t really like her!","Jacqueline Piper"
"I really enjoyed lots of aspects of this book. The history of the area; impact of war on her parents. It’s is well written and an interesting way to construct a memoir.","Sarah Wheatley"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"
"Loved this audiobook. It’s going straight onto my Favourites shelf. Suspect it may be my best book of 2020...","chris tervit"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"
"Any book that mentions Hamish Imlach must be worth 5 stars. Seriously though worth a read.","David Hill"

"I loved the social history and it was a real trip down memory lane for me as we are the same age but I didn’t really like her!","Jacqueline Piper"

"If I could give it 6 stars I would!","Sarah-Louise Bamblett"
"A slow burner...I felt like giving up on the book during the first couple of chapters but I am glad I persevered. A very well written book that evokes memories of growing up in Lanarkshire.","Tracy Donachie"
"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"Three and a half stars - a little too bleak ...made me sad ...","Claire O'Sullivan"
"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.
#alphabetsoup","Colette Coen"
"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town
A poignant tale of a girl growing up in a small Scots town with an old fashioned david and a narcissistic mother and how the relationship with them affected her for the rest of her life.","Jenifer Lavery"
"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"
"Any book that mentions Hamish Imlach must be worth 5 stars. Seriously though worth a read.","David Hill"

"I loved the social history and it was a real trip down memory lane for me as we are the same age but I didn’t really like her!","Jacqueline Piper"

"A slow burner...I felt like giving up on the book during the first couple of chapters but I am glad I persevered. A very well written book that evokes memories of growing up in Lanarkshire.","Tracy Donachie"
"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"Three and a half stars - a little too bleak ...made me sad ...","Claire O'Sullivan"
"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town
A poignant tale of a girl growing up in a small Scots town with an old fashioned david and a narcissistic mother and how the relationship with them affected her for the rest of her life.","Jenifer Lavery"
"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"
"Any book that mentions Hamish Imlach must be worth 5 stars. Seriously though worth a read.","David Hill"
"3.5 rounded to 4*","Kirsten Mackie"
"I loved the social history and it was a real trip down memory lane for me as we are the same age but I didn’t really like her!","Jacqueline Piper"
"I really enjoyed lots of aspects of this book. The history of the area; impact of war on her parents. It’s is well written and an interesting way to construct a memoir.","Sarah Wheatley"

"If I could give it 6 stars I would!","Sarah-Louise Bamblett"
"A slow burner...I felt like giving up on the book during the first couple of chapters but I am glad I persevered. A very well written book that evokes memories of growing up in Lanarkshire.","Tracy Donachie"
"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town
A poignant tale of a girl growing up in a small Scots town with an old fashioned david and a narcissistic mother and how the relationship with them affected her for the rest of her life.","Jenifer Lavery"
"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's

Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people

One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town

"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"

"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"The author is angry with her parents, and the emotional abuse she endured will surely ring bells with many readers growing up in the 60s or 70s whose parents were shaped by the same social mores and political circumstances. Reading the book made me reflect on my own feelings towards my parents, and think about what my children might think about me. We're all of us affected by our socio political environment - and that has changed so much since the 1960s / 70s. A psychoanalyst tells the author it's the little things that you have to watch out for - these things leave their mark. Definitely food for thought, but I'm genuinely in two minds about how useful too much examination is. Is this itself narcissistic? (A criticism the author levels at her own parents and ex husband too). An interesting read; quite sad and a bit depressing.","Emma Tiller"

"Reading this made me grateful to be an immigrant in a foreign land and therefore always an outsider, here and in HK. Fitting in is so overrated. I thought her life was completely horrendous. My parents’s lives, education and generation were entirely different to hers but they took it in their stride I would go to University and get a job. Maybe it was me but they probably knew criticism would just wash over me. If they disapproved, I never cared. And men! I’ve never been more grateful for John after reading this. Is it wrong to be eternally grateful I need never read this again?","Yeemay"
"Deborah Orr was a name I vaguely knew from her articles and her marriage to Will Self but I read the book because her Scotland was partially my Scotland. I came from the other side of Glasgow but had friends who worked in British Steel and Ravenscraig punctuated Glasgow as did the shipyards The industrial side and Orr writes about her childhood in Motherwell and her Glasgow but then she moved to St Andrews my St Andrews where she goes to the University and hates it.
Her parents are strict and difficult and she longs for their approval and love.
Her experiences of Scotland are different from mine My family was confident and loving but I recognise the angst,so many of my friends experienced it and no woman who grew up in the 70s and 8os could fail to be moved by her story.
I was so sad to find she died last year she had quite the story to tell","Fiona"
"I I thought I would enjoy this book but I found the constant criticism of her parents and the psychological terms she described them in very hard going. We get it you didn’t get on with them.","Frances maguire"
"What a book full of misery. Thought my family was dysfunctional till I read this. An upbringing purporting to be happy, bordering on child abuse.
Growing up in the same era as myself, I recognise and relate to the social history but the fallout for this woman is crushing..","Sue"
"While I enjoyed this memoir on the whole I struggled to keep up the pace in the second half of the book. I was getting weary with the self-indulgence (perhaps this is the point of a memoir). It felt as if Deborah had been ‘over counselled’. She used the word narcissist way too frequently. I did enjoy the parts that described (rather harshly at times) life in Motherwell in the 70’s but I felt overall the book was a tad too long and overly wordy. Would I recommend? Yes but with a caveat - well written childhood memoir punctuated with excessive and rather irritating cod psychology ramblings.","Kazamate"
"The maws a bit shan. Aye, guid.","Caroline Gibson"
"A good book and for me apart from Debra Orr’s personal struggle, shows clearly that any person that believes a Tory government understands or cares about the majority of working people is seriously in denial. It was a brave book for Debra Orr to write considering her tragic illness.","Keith Lucas"

"mummy issues but make it difficult to read","Carys Morris"
"I have to say this book has been hard to get into. But after about half of it, I felt I could relate so deeply to the author and her experience that, in the end, the book left a mark on me. Luckily, I have had an easier life so far than Deborah Orr has had - whilst also being captured by the beauty of many of her childhood experiences- and I have grown up in a different time (with much more progressive parents). Still, as a daughter, this book still helped me to understand more about my childhood, my relationship to my parents and my childhood home. Also, though I feel the author would have disagreed, the book showed me the importance small souvenirs of our lives past can help us in revisiting and remembering. It will not be a book for everyone, but I am really thankful to the author for the climpse into her past she shared with me.","Outdoor Economist"
"This is a truly honest memoir of Deborah Orr's life growing up in Motherwell, Scotland, in a housing estate. She describes living in a working class community but her focus is mainly on her family dynamics and in particular, her relationship with her mother which was multifaceted and complicated.
There are many elements within this book that many of us will associate with in our own growing up years and some long forgotten memories may surface on reading this novel. I recommend this no holds barred account of one woman's life.","Anne"

"A raw memoir from the late Deborah Orr, I thought ""Motherwell"" was eloquently and poignantly written, depicting difficult family dynamics and the way they affected her life well into adulthood.
I gave it a 7/10 and the full review can be found here: https://www.2percentbooks.com/motherw...","Grace"
"I didn't get on with this as well as I thought I should. I did enjoy her descriptions of Motherwell and surroundings, industrial Ravenscraig... I read the book because, despite knowing little about DO, people who I rated talked of her lust for life (when she was alive) and her razor-sharp wit. She also had been married to Will Self and that was the thing that propelled me to her, ""what character could ever be married to Will Self?!"" Her autobiography meandered through Motherwell and her parents took centre stage. But her story did not move me, it sounded like a familiar refrain amongst many children of parents of that generation :staying in unhappy marriages, not living out their potential, making do, keeping up with the neighbours. A familiar continuing refrain. I didn't dislike it but neither did I marvel at her writing.","Susannah"
"I nearly gave up on this once and then it unfolded to be brilliant. I hope Orr is somewhere with her mum, having the relationship she wanted.","K"
"Heartbreaking, lovely, as train-of-thought as memoirs often are. Such a fascinating insight into how parents are often a bundle of contradictions - one page Orr was describing how terrible her mother was, the next how much she loved and admired her. I would have loved to have read more about Orr’s later life, which felt quite squashed into the final few chapters - but it didn’t spoil what was a really beautiful - if also sad, angry and spiteful at points - book.","R H"
"Beautifully written. But we know Deborah Orr has a way with words. Feelings of anger but also great sadness.","Maria"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"
"Any book that mentions Hamish Imlach must be worth 5 stars. Seriously though worth a read.","David Hill"

"A slow burner...I felt like giving up on the book during the first couple of chapters but I am glad I persevered. A very well written book that evokes memories of growing up in Lanarkshire.","Tracy Donachie"
"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"Three and a half stars - a little too bleak ...made me sad ...","Claire O'Sullivan"
"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.
#alphabetsoup","Colette Coen"
"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town
A poignant tale of a girl growing up in a small Scots town with an old fashioned david and a narcissistic mother and how the relationship with them affected her for the rest of her life.","Jenifer Lavery"
"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"The author is angry with her parents, and the emotional abuse she endured will surely ring bells with many readers growing up in the 60s or 70s whose parents were shaped by the same social mores and political circumstances. Reading the book made me reflect on my own feelings towards my parents, and think about what my children might think about me. We're all of us affected by our socio political environment - and that has changed so much since the 1960s / 70s. A psychoanalyst tells the author it's the little things that you have to watch out for - these things leave their mark. Definitely food for thought, but I'm genuinely in two minds about how useful too much examination is. Is this itself narcissistic? (A criticism the author levels at her own parents and ex husband too). An interesting read; quite sad and a bit depressing.","Emma Tiller"

"Reading this made me grateful to be an immigrant in a foreign land and therefore always an outsider, here and in HK. Fitting in is so overrated. I thought her life was completely horrendous. My parents’s lives, education and generation were entirely different to hers but they took it in their stride I would go to University and get a job. Maybe it was me but they probably knew criticism would just wash over me. If they disapproved, I never cared. And men! I’ve never been more grateful for John after reading this. Is it wrong to be eternally grateful I need never read this again?","Yeemay"
"Deborah Orr was a name I vaguely knew from her articles and her marriage to Will Self but I read the book because her Scotland was partially my Scotland. I came from the other side of Glasgow but had friends who worked in British Steel and Ravenscraig punctuated Glasgow as did the shipyards The industrial side and Orr writes about her childhood in Motherwell and her Glasgow but then she moved to St Andrews my St Andrews where she goes to the University and hates it.
Her parents are strict and difficult and she longs for their approval and love.
Her experiences of Scotland are different from mine My family was confident and loving but I recognise the angst,so many of my friends experienced it and no woman who grew up in the 70s and 8os could fail to be moved by her story.
I was so sad to find she died last year she had quite the story to tell","Fiona"
"I I thought I would enjoy this book but I found the constant criticism of her parents and the psychological terms she described them in very hard going. We get it you didn’t get on with them.","Frances maguire"
"What a book full of misery. Thought my family was dysfunctional till I read this. An upbringing purporting to be happy, bordering on child abuse.
Growing up in the same era as myself, I recognise and relate to the social history but the fallout for this woman is crushing..","Sue"
"While I enjoyed this memoir on the whole I struggled to keep up the pace in the second half of the book. I was getting weary with the self-indulgence (perhaps this is the point of a memoir). It felt as if Deborah had been ‘over counselled’. She used the word narcissist way too frequently. I did enjoy the parts that described (rather harshly at times) life in Motherwell in the 70’s but I felt overall the book was a tad too long and overly wordy. Would I recommend? Yes but with a caveat - well written childhood memoir punctuated with excessive and rather irritating cod psychology ramblings.","Kazamate"
"The maws a bit shan. Aye, guid.","Caroline Gibson"
"A good book and for me apart from Debra Orr’s personal struggle, shows clearly that any person that believes a Tory government understands or cares about the majority of working people is seriously in denial. It was a brave book for Debra Orr to write considering her tragic illness.","Keith Lucas"
"Loved this, we similar age so triggered lots of memories for me whilst reading even though I wasn't brought up in Scotland. Not my normal reading genre but made a nice change.","Sandra"
"mummy issues but make it difficult to read","Carys Morris"
"I have to say this book has been hard to get into. But after about half of it, I felt I could relate so deeply to the author and her experience that, in the end, the book left a mark on me. Luckily, I have had an easier life so far than Deborah Orr has had - whilst also being captured by the beauty of many of her childhood experiences- and I have grown up in a different time (with much more progressive parents). Still, as a daughter, this book still helped me to understand more about my childhood, my relationship to my parents and my childhood home. Also, though I feel the author would have disagreed, the book showed me the importance small souvenirs of our lives past can help us in revisiting and remembering. It will not be a book for everyone, but I am really thankful to the author for the climpse into her past she shared with me.","Outdoor Economist"
"This is a truly honest memoir of Deborah Orr's life growing up in Motherwell, Scotland, in a housing estate. She describes living in a working class community but her focus is mainly on her family dynamics and in particular, her relationship with her mother which was multifaceted and complicated.
There are many elements within this book that many of us will associate with in our own growing up years and some long forgotten memories may surface on reading this novel. I recommend this no holds barred account of one woman's life.","Anne"
"I started reading this not long after the author had died. She was a wonderful writer and I enjoyed her work in The Guardian before alot. You don't get writers like that in the Guardian these days. This book is fantastic as well and I sobbed at the end.","MistyM"

"A raw memoir from the late Deborah Orr, I thought ""Motherwell"" was eloquently and poignantly written, depicting difficult family dynamics and the way they affected her life well into adulthood.
I gave it a 7/10 and the full review can be found here: https://www.2percentbooks.com/motherw...","Grace"
"I didn't get on with this as well as I thought I should. I did enjoy her descriptions of Motherwell and surroundings, industrial Ravenscraig... I read the book because, despite knowing little about DO, people who I rated talked of her lust for life (when she was alive) and her razor-sharp wit. She also had been married to Will Self and that was the thing that propelled me to her, ""what character could ever be married to Will Self?!"" Her autobiography meandered through Motherwell and her parents took centre stage. But her story did not move me, it sounded like a familiar refrain amongst many children of parents of that generation :staying in unhappy marriages, not living out their potential, making do, keeping up with the neighbours. A familiar continuing refrain. I didn't dislike it but neither did I marvel at her writing.","Susannah"
"I nearly gave up on this once and then it unfolded to be brilliant. I hope Orr is somewhere with her mum, having the relationship she wanted.","K"
"Heartbreaking, lovely, as train-of-thought as memoirs often are. Such a fascinating insight into how parents are often a bundle of contradictions - one page Orr was describing how terrible her mother was, the next how much she loved and admired her. I would have loved to have read more about Orr’s later life, which felt quite squashed into the final few chapters - but it didn’t spoil what was a really beautiful - if also sad, angry and spiteful at points - book.","R H"

"Family
A personal view of working class family life in an industrial town which was then torn apart by the Ravenscraig closure and consequent unemployment.

"Well written and incisive. Loved the opportunity to revisit life in the 1970s.","Mary Clarkson"
"Loved this book. Intense heartfelt description of the authors childhood and adolescence growing up in such a stultifying restrictive family home environment, within such a self contained town, which dogged her whole life.
Such a shame that she is no longer with us and still writing.","Nigel Baylem"
"compelling and bleak account of a scottish childhood with serious mother issues against the backdrop of 60s and 70s britain. I was sad to read that her hard won escape to university did not bring happiness.","Jane Curry"
"Really happy to have read this book - a true account of childhood and a second-hand account of motherhood in the 1960s, the same kind of time my mum was a child and my grandmother was a mother.","Elin"
"Social history
I found this book annoying, intriguing, part social history,part family dynamics, part memoir.
It was an interesting read but I don't think I would recommend it","rosemary wood"
"Such a very personal and exposing memoir. Scotland, narcissism, family, relationships, class and university. Lots in it to relate to.","Mrs"
"An excellent memoir - honest, thoughtful and self-aware. Some startling sections on her parents’ response to her emerging sexuality and (separately) the shocking sexual violence she suffered.","Thomas"
"I don't know why I thought that this memoir would cover more of the adult life as well and moving to London - because the title states quite explicity what it covers. This is both a personal story as well as the story of a generation and a place.","Marina Sofia"
"BBC Book of the week. Heard one episode and thought I would give it a go.
As she said it was like growing up in a religious cult without the religion. A tough read","Jamad"
"This was a strange book to read. I'm aware it was finished under difficult circumstances but, in my view, much of the half baked theorising about narcissism should have been ruthlessly edited out. I also think it was a bad call to make so much of the book a complaint about her mother even if it did mean Orr could make the connection with name of the town she grew up in - her mother did not ""Mother well"". Reading the book however I was left with the strong impression that both her parents, especially her mother, loved her very much and did the best they could. The sum of her mother's failings seem to add up to some hurtful remarks and insecurity over the years but I think a fair daughter would have weighed this against all the love and care and trips to the library and support to do well at school etc and not have felt the need for this public excoriation. Win was not without fault but I ended up feeling very sorry for her. I don't think she deserved this posthumous treatment. I wonder if Orr had had a chance to revise the book a few more times, if a more polished gem would have emerged- there's no doubt she had a way with words and a story to tell about herself and her girlhood and Motherwell and class and feminism amongst other things. As it was it felt like she was focused on reliving trauma and blaming her mother for everything.I read Ben Watt's memoir about his parents ""Romany and Tom"" recently and I think that was a better and fairer portrait of a parental relationship which did not ignore problematic aspects but which placed these properly in context.","Amanda"
"A really bleak story. I suppose it resonated a bit with me because she’s just a little bit younger than me and at university I had a boyfriend from Wishaw, not that I had the family experience that she did. Overwhelming in parts particularly the university years and beyond. Well worth reading though.","Frances Bestley"

"Raw, emotional, powerful and uncompromising laced with a hint of humour.","Wendy Temple"
"Exceptionally perceptive as autobiographies go. This is a great deal less culpatory than I thought it would be, but there is a tightly controlled subsurface fury that makes the whole book hum. It’s irresistible.","John Feetenby"
"I read this essentially in one sitting, after wanting to read it for a while. What I will say is I wish I'd read more of Deborah Orr's journalism while she was alive. In many ways her life echoes my own and I felt at points I was reading my own autobiography. There are some difficult parts to read in this.
Deborah's life as someone who is intelligent and possesses critical thinking skills from a young age is out of step with the working class community she grew up in. She doesn't fit in. Her parents had extremely traditional views that clashed with Deborah's own surrounding pre marital sex and what a woman's place is.
Deborah was brought up in Scotland's oppressive 60s and 70s while the country's social conventions were still gripped by presbyterianism, things haven't really changed for young women growing up in post industrial towns in working class Scotland - especially if their parents were brought up in such an oppressive environment.
Great books are ones in which you learn something about yourself from reading. I've certainly had a lot of food for thought from this.","Lauren Gilmour"
"A phenomenal read by the late and truly great journalist Deborah Orr, who herself questioned whether the book was memoir therapy or vengeance.
Orr was raised in working class Lanarkshire, Scotland, in a time and place when girls were expected to be seen and not heard. They certainly weren't expected to go off to university and become award winning journalists or 'career girls' as her mother would dismissively label her. She delves deep into her childhood and uncovers a passive narcissism which can run through families and entire towns, that can shape personalities and blur boundaries.
Having grown up in the seventies, there were several times I had to put this book down, take some deep breaths and reflect on the era I grew up in, and the expectations and judgements surrounding us.
I can honestly say that I finished this book feeling like I'd had therapy myself! I only wish Deborah was around to thank. A must read for women born in the sixties and seventies.","Betsy Price"
"Soms vraag ik me af of recencenten de boeken die ze bespreken ook wel werkelijk gelezen hebben.
Vooral in de Britse pers werd dit boek lovend onthaald, volgens mij ten onrechte.
Ik vond het eerder overroepen en kon me nog het beste vinden in de bespreking ervan die verscheen in de Nederlandse krant Het Parool.
Was het wel allemaal zo erg?
De auteur beschrijft nogal veel niet ter zake doende details, die soms op zich wel interessant zijn, zoals de sociale huisvesting in Groot Brittannië. Maar ze gaat daarin te ver. Ook kwam hetgeen ze schreef op mij vaak onsamenhangend over. Ze alludeert vaak op wat nog moet komen qua negatieve eigenschappen van haar moeder, waar ze het blijkbaar erg moeilijk mee had. Maar zo vreselijk vond ik die vrouw achteraf niet.
Wat Deborah Orr blijkbaar wil vertellen over haar ouders, hoe erg zij wel werd behandeld, komt helemaal niet uit de verf, net door het te veel bewandelen van zijwegen.
Jammer.","Lili Bammens"
"This is a touching and poignant memoir of Deborah’s Orr upbringing and the role her family played in shaping her whether these be positive or negative memories. The book’s sociological depictions are completely accurate of a post war period of renewal and rejuvenation of this area of Glasgow but there is also great courage in its manner of uncovering family secrets. (There can be few better accounts of how the postwar working-class strove so complicatedly for “betterness”.) (O’Hagan 2020 in the Guardian)
Deborah escaped to London where she was to marry the journalist and novelist Will Self and I enjoyed her depiction of life with Will Self, she is disconcertingly honest and self-revealing about many parts of her life throughout this book. So much so that parts of it stay with you long after you have put the book back from wherever it came.","Moira McLoughlin"
"I didn't enjoy this at all. It felt to me that she was unfair to her mother, as her father was equally to blame for much of what went on at home. She just liked her father more.
I also felt that blaming her mother entirely for her PTSD was unfair when she'd endured some other horrific experiences (a gang rape and a further rape / violent assault, several terminations of pregnancy), as well as long term bullying at school, all of which must surely have contributed.
And the stuff about narcissism was repetitive and inaccurate. At one point she even admits no psychiatrist would consider her mother a narcissist. Well, in that case surely she wasn't one!","Judith Rich"
"Bit of an impulse purchase, Hadn't heard anything about this book before buying it.
Slow to start, kept waiting for something dramatic to happen and it doesn't. It has received high praise but left me underwhelmed and a bit bored.
She makes a lot of complaints about her mother not supporting her wanting more of a life for herself than just to leave school, get married and have children and although I can understand how that must have been difficult I did read it thinking 'And?' and 'So What?'","Ann"
"I don’t think I’d heard of Deborah Orr until just before she died, but felt compelled to read her book, interested in her upbringing in a Scottish town. “Motherwell” is beautifully complex and thoughtful - an intriguing examination of the nuances and effects of childhood and parental relationships.","Calum Falconer"
"Repetitive psychoanalysis of her family who are apparently all narcissists… as she mentions every other page. Some interesting childhood anecdotes and a nice portrait of her home town but the structure was messy, the writing was poor, and I struggled to have much sympathy for the author as she (it seemed to me) whinged and whinged and whinged.","Poppy Hicks"
"I really miss Deborah’s writing and loved her brutally honest memoir. Although younger and male, my parents were of the same generation as hers and I recognise so many of the situations she writes about. I","Christopher"

"With so many cultural references familiar to me and describing not only her life but the era this was a hit.","Clare"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"Three and a half stars - a little too bleak ...made me sad ...","Claire O'Sullivan"
"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.
#alphabetsoup","Colette Coen"
"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town

"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"The author is angry with her parents, and the emotional abuse she endured will surely ring bells with many readers growing up in the 60s or 70s whose parents were shaped by the same social mores and political circumstances. Reading the book made me reflect on my own feelings towards my parents, and think about what my children might think about me. We're all of us affected by our socio political environment - and that has changed so much since the 1960s / 70s. A psychoanalyst tells the author it's the little things that you have to watch out for - these things leave their mark. Definitely food for thought, but I'm genuinely in two minds about how useful too much examination is. Is this itself narcissistic? (A criticism the author levels at her own parents and ex husband too). An interesting read; quite sad and a bit depressing.","Emma Tiller"

"Reading this made me grateful to be an immigrant in a foreign land and therefore always an outsider, here and in HK. Fitting in is so overrated. I thought her life was completely horrendous. My parents’s lives, education and generation were entirely different to hers but they took it in their stride I would go to University and get a job. Maybe it was me but they probably knew criticism would just wash over me. If they disapproved, I never cared. And men! I’ve never been more grateful for John after reading this. Is it wrong to be eternally grateful I need never read this again?","Yeemay"
"Deborah Orr was a name I vaguely knew from her articles and her marriage to Will Self but I read the book because her Scotland was partially my Scotland. I came from the other side of Glasgow but had friends who worked in British Steel and Ravenscraig punctuated Glasgow as did the shipyards The industrial side and Orr writes about her childhood in Motherwell and her Glasgow but then she moved to St Andrews my St Andrews where she goes to the University and hates it.
Her parents are strict and difficult and she longs for their approval and love.
Her experiences of Scotland are different from mine My family was confident and loving but I recognise the angst,so many of my friends experienced it and no woman who grew up in the 70s and 8os could fail to be moved by her story.
I was so sad to find she died last year she had quite the story to tell","Fiona"
"I I thought I would enjoy this book but I found the constant criticism of her parents and the psychological terms she described them in very hard going. We get it you didn’t get on with them.","Frances maguire"
"What a book full of misery. Thought my family was dysfunctional till I read this. An upbringing purporting to be happy, bordering on child abuse.
Growing up in the same era as myself, I recognise and relate to the social history but the fallout for this woman is crushing..","Sue"
"While I enjoyed this memoir on the whole I struggled to keep up the pace in the second half of the book. I was getting weary with the self-indulgence (perhaps this is the point of a memoir). It felt as if Deborah had been ‘over counselled’. She used the word narcissist way too frequently. I did enjoy the parts that described (rather harshly at times) life in Motherwell in the 70’s but I felt overall the book was a tad too long and overly wordy. Would I recommend? Yes but with a caveat - well written childhood memoir punctuated with excessive and rather irritating cod psychology ramblings.","Kazamate"
"The maws a bit shan. Aye, guid.","Caroline Gibson"
"A good book and for me apart from Debra Orr’s personal struggle, shows clearly that any person that believes a Tory government understands or cares about the majority of working people is seriously in denial. It was a brave book for Debra Orr to write considering her tragic illness.","Keith Lucas"

"mummy issues but make it difficult to read","Carys Morris"
"I have to say this book has been hard to get into. But after about half of it, I felt I could relate so deeply to the author and her experience that, in the end, the book left a mark on me. Luckily, I have had an easier life so far than Deborah Orr has had - whilst also being captured by the beauty of many of her childhood experiences- and I have grown up in a different time (with much more progressive parents). Still, as a daughter, this book still helped me to understand more about my childhood, my relationship to my parents and my childhood home. Also, though I feel the author would have disagreed, the book showed me the importance small souvenirs of our lives past can help us in revisiting and remembering. It will not be a book for everyone, but I am really thankful to the author for the climpse into her past she shared with me.","Outdoor Economist"
"This is a truly honest memoir of Deborah Orr's life growing up in Motherwell, Scotland, in a housing estate. She describes living in a working class community but her focus is mainly on her family dynamics and in particular, her relationship with her mother which was multifaceted and complicated.
There are many elements within this book that many of us will associate with in our own growing up years and some long forgotten memories may surface on reading this novel. I recommend this no holds barred account of one woman's life.","Anne"
"I started reading this not long after the author had died. She was a wonderful writer and I enjoyed her work in The Guardian before alot. You don't get writers like that in the Guardian these days. This book is fantastic as well and I sobbed at the end.","MistyM"
"Not sure what the point of this book is, I don't feel like I learnt anything and it wasn't funny, although Deborah seems like she was a really interesting person. This just didn't seem like her best material?","Michelle"
"A raw memoir from the late Deborah Orr, I thought ""Motherwell"" was eloquently and poignantly written, depicting difficult family dynamics and the way they affected her life well into adulthood.
I gave it a 7/10 and the full review can be found here: https://www.2percentbooks.com/motherw...","Grace"
"I didn't get on with this as well as I thought I should. I did enjoy her descriptions of Motherwell and surroundings, industrial Ravenscraig... I read the book because, despite knowing little about DO, people who I rated talked of her lust for life (when she was alive) and her razor-sharp wit. She also had been married to Will Self and that was the thing that propelled me to her, ""what character could ever be married to Will Self?!"" Her autobiography meandered through Motherwell and her parents took centre stage. But her story did not move me, it sounded like a familiar refrain amongst many children of parents of that generation :staying in unhappy marriages, not living out their potential, making do, keeping up with the neighbours. A familiar continuing refrain. I didn't dislike it but neither did I marvel at her writing.","Susannah"
"I nearly gave up on this once and then it unfolded to be brilliant. I hope Orr is somewhere with her mum, having the relationship she wanted.","K"
"Heartbreaking, lovely, as train-of-thought as memoirs often are. Such a fascinating insight into how parents are often a bundle of contradictions - one page Orr was describing how terrible her mother was, the next how much she loved and admired her. I would have loved to have read more about Orr’s later life, which felt quite squashed into the final few chapters - but it didn’t spoil what was a really beautiful - if also sad, angry and spiteful at points - book.","R H"
"Beautifully written. But we know Deborah Orr has a way with words. Feelings of anger but also great sadness.","Maria"
"Incredible, I have never read anything quite like Motherwell.","liza"
"Family
A personal view of working class family life in an industrial town which was then torn apart by the Ravenscraig closure and consequent unemployment. The end of the 20th century saw huge social change and the emergence of truly liberated females. Deborah is my abe, lived locally and had many similar experiences to me","vhari ainsworth"
"Well written and incisive. Loved the opportunity to revisit life in the 1970s.","Mary Clarkson"
"Loved this book. Intense heartfelt description of the authors childhood and adolescence growing up in such a stultifying restrictive family home environment, within such a self contained town, which dogged her whole life.
Such a shame that she is no longer with us and still writing.","Nigel Baylem"
"compelling and bleak account of a scottish childhood with serious mother issues against the backdrop of 60s and 70s britain. I was sad to read that her hard won escape to university did not bring happiness.","Jane Curry"
"Really happy to have read this book - a true account of childhood and a second-hand account of motherhood in the 1960s, the same kind of time my mum was a child and my grandmother was a mother.","Elin"
"Social history
I found this book annoying, intriguing, part social history,part family dynamics, part memoir.
It was an interesting read but I don't think I would recommend it","rosemary wood"
"Such a very personal and exposing memoir. Scotland, narcissism, family, relationships, class and university. Lots in it to relate to.","Mrs"
"An excellent memoir - honest, thoughtful and self-aware. Some startling sections on her parents’ response to her emerging sexuality and (separately) the shocking sexual violence she suffered.","Thomas"
"I don't know why I thought that this memoir would cover more of the adult life as well and moving to London - because the title states quite explicity what it covers. This is both a personal story as well as the story of a generation and a place.","Marina Sofia"
"BBC Book of the week. Heard one episode and thought I would give it a go.
As she said it was like growing up in a religious cult without the religion. A tough read","Jamad"
"This was a strange book to read. I'm aware it was finished under difficult circumstances but, in my view, much of the half baked theorising about narcissism should have been ruthlessly edited out. I also think it was a bad call to make so much of the book a complaint about her mother even if it did mean Orr could make the connection with name of the town she grew up in - her mother did not ""Mother well"". Reading the book however I was left with the strong impression that both her parents, especially her mother, loved her very much and did the best they could. The sum of her mother's failings seem to add up to some hurtful remarks and insecurity over the years but I think a fair daughter would have weighed this against all the love and care and trips to the library and support to do well at school etc and not have felt the need for this public excoriation. Win was not without fault but I ended up feeling very sorry for her. I don't think she deserved this posthumous treatment. I wonder if Orr had had a chance to revise the book a few more times, if a more polished gem would have emerged- there's no doubt she had a way with words and a story to tell about herself and her girlhood and Motherwell and class and feminism amongst other things. As it was it felt like she was focused on reliving trauma and blaming her mother for everything.I read Ben Watt's memoir about his parents ""Romany and Tom"" recently and I think that was a better and fairer portrait of a parental relationship which did not ignore problematic aspects but which placed these properly in context.","Amanda"
"A really bleak story. I suppose it resonated a bit with me because she’s just a little bit younger than me and at university I had a boyfriend from Wishaw, not that I had the family experience that she did. Overwhelming in parts particularly the university years and beyond. Well worth reading though.","Frances Bestley"
"Rarely read bios/auto bios but I adored this! Laugh out loud at times but poignant and so recognisable in others! A fantastic read!","Deborah Noble"
"BBC Radio 4 book of the week. Mildly interesting but nothing more.","Andrew"
"Raw, emotional, powerful and uncompromising laced with a hint of humour.","Wendy Temple"
"Exceptionally perceptive as autobiographies go. This is a great deal less culpatory than I thought it would be, but there is a tightly controlled subsurface fury that makes the whole book hum. It’s irresistible.","John Feetenby"
"I read this essentially in one sitting, after wanting to read it for a while. What I will say is I wish I'd read more of Deborah Orr's journalism while she was alive. In many ways her life echoes my own and I felt at points I was reading my own autobiography. There are some difficult parts to read in this.
Deborah's life as someone who is intelligent and possesses critical thinking skills from a young age is out of step with the working class community she grew up in. She doesn't fit in. Her parents had extremely traditional views that clashed with Deborah's own surrounding pre marital sex and what a woman's place is.
Deborah was brought up in Scotland's oppressive 60s and 70s while the country's social conventions were still gripped by presbyterianism, things haven't really changed for young women growing up in post industrial towns in working class Scotland - especially if their parents were brought up in such an oppressive environment.
Great books are ones in which you learn something about yourself from reading. I've certainly had a lot of food for thought from this.","Lauren Gilmour"
"A phenomenal read by the late and truly great journalist Deborah Orr, who herself questioned whether the book was memoir therapy or vengeance.
Orr was raised in working class Lanarkshire, Scotland, in a time and place when girls were expected to be seen and not heard. They certainly weren't expected to go off to university and become award winning journalists or 'career girls' as her mother would dismissively label her. She delves deep into her childhood and uncovers a passive narcissism which can run through families and entire towns, that can shape personalities and blur boundaries.
Having grown up in the seventies, there were several times I had to put this book down, take some deep breaths and reflect on the era I grew up in, and the expectations and judgements surrounding us.
I can honestly say that I finished this book feeling like I'd had therapy myself! I only wish Deborah was around to thank. A must read for women born in the sixties and seventies.","Betsy Price"
"Soms vraag ik me af of recencenten de boeken die ze bespreken ook wel werkelijk gelezen hebben.
Vooral in de Britse pers werd dit boek lovend onthaald, volgens mij ten onrechte.
Ik vond het eerder overroepen en kon me nog het beste vinden in de bespreking ervan die verscheen in de Nederlandse krant Het Parool.
Was het wel allemaal zo erg?
De auteur beschrijft nogal veel niet ter zake doende details, die soms op zich wel interessant zijn, zoals de sociale huisvesting in Groot Brittannië. Maar ze gaat daarin te ver. Ook kwam hetgeen ze schreef op mij vaak onsamenhangend over. Ze alludeert vaak op wat nog moet komen qua negatieve eigenschappen van haar moeder, waar ze het blijkbaar erg moeilijk mee had. Maar zo vreselijk vond ik die vrouw achteraf niet.
Wat Deborah Orr blijkbaar wil vertellen over haar ouders, hoe erg zij wel werd behandeld, komt helemaal niet uit de verf, net door het te veel bewandelen van zijwegen.
Jammer.","Lili Bammens"
"This is a touching and poignant memoir of Deborah’s Orr upbringing and the role her family played in shaping her whether these be positive or negative memories. The book’s sociological depictions are completely accurate of a post war period of renewal and rejuvenation of this area of Glasgow but there is also great courage in its manner of uncovering family secrets. (There can be few better accounts of how the postwar working-class strove so complicatedly for “betterness”.) (O’Hagan 2020 in the Guardian)
Deborah escaped to London where she was to marry the journalist and novelist Will Self and I enjoyed her depiction of life with Will Self, she is disconcertingly honest and self-revealing about many parts of her life throughout this book. So much so that parts of it stay with you long after you have put the book back from wherever it came.","Moira McLoughlin"
"I didn't enjoy this at all. It felt to me that she was unfair to her mother, as her father was equally to blame for much of what went on at home. She just liked her father more.
I also felt that blaming her mother entirely for her PTSD was unfair when she'd endured some other horrific experiences (a gang rape and a further rape / violent assault, several terminations of pregnancy), as well as long term bullying at school, all of which must surely have contributed.
And the stuff about narcissism was repetitive and inaccurate. At one point she even admits no psychiatrist would consider her mother a narcissist. Well, in that case surely she wasn't one!","Judith Rich"
"Bit of an impulse purchase, Hadn't heard anything about this book before buying it.
Slow to start, kept waiting for something dramatic to happen and it doesn't. It has received high praise but left me underwhelmed and a bit bored.
She makes a lot of complaints about her mother not supporting her wanting more of a life for herself than just to leave school, get married and have children and although I can understand how that must have been difficult I did read it thinking 'And?' and 'So What?'","Ann"
"I don’t think I’d heard of Deborah Orr until just before she died, but felt compelled to read her book, interested in her upbringing in a Scottish town. “Motherwell” is beautifully complex and thoughtful - an intriguing examination of the nuances and effects of childhood and parental relationships.","Calum Falconer"
"Repetitive psychoanalysis of her family who are apparently all narcissists… as she mentions every other page. Some interesting childhood anecdotes and a nice portrait of her home town but the structure was messy, the writing was poor, and I struggled to have much sympathy for the author as she (it seemed to me) whinged and whinged and whinged.","Poppy Hicks"
"I really miss Deborah’s writing and loved her brutally honest memoir. Although younger and male, my parents were of the same generation as hers and I recognise so many of the situations she writes about. I","Christopher"
"As a contemporary of the author and having grown up in a working class town ""up North"" I'd expected a gentle nostalgia trip. Yes, some memories revived for me but this is a brutally honest memoir which I'll reflect on for quite a while to come. Compelling.","Steve"
"(unsure how to write this considering the multitude of v sad circumstances but I found it q hard to engage with until about pg 200)","KW"
"Absolutely loved this book. Reminders of my own childhood. The bureau that held all the mysterious important docs We had one in fact still do!!","Deb"
"With so many cultural references familiar to me and describing not only her life but the era this was a hit.","Clare"
"Brilliant, wonderfully written and captures 1970s/80s Scotland exceptionally well.","Gillian Norrie"
"A generally good read which recounts the life of Deborah Orr growing up in Motherwell. Despite appearing at time to be a random stream of consciousness rather a linear narrative I would recommend.","Lauren"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"
"Loved this audiobook. It’s going straight onto my Favourites shelf. Suspect it may be my best book of 2020...","chris tervit"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town
A poignant tale of a girl growing up in a small Scots town with an old fashioned david and a narcissistic mother and how the relationship with them affected her for the rest of her life.","Jenifer Lavery"
"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"The author is angry with her parents, and the emotional abuse she endured will surely ring bells with many readers growing up in the 60s or 70s whose parents were shaped by the same social mores and political circumstances. Reading the book made me reflect on my own feelings towards my parents, and think about what my children might think about me. We're all of us affected by our socio political environment - and that has changed so much since the 1960s / 70s. A psychoanalyst tells the author it's the little things that you have to watch out for - these things leave their mark. Definitely food for thought, but I'm genuinely in two minds about how useful too much examination is. Is this itself narcissistic? (A criticism the author levels at her own parents and ex husband too). An interesting read; quite sad and a bit depressing.","Emma Tiller"

"Reading this made me grateful to be an immigrant in a foreign land and therefore always an outsider, here and in HK. Fitting in is so overrated. I thought her life was completely horrendous. My parents’s lives, education and generation were entirely different to hers but they took it in their stride I would go to University and get a job. Maybe it was me but they probably knew criticism would just wash over me. If they disapproved, I never cared. And men! I’ve never been more grateful for John after reading this. Is it wrong to be eternally grateful I need never read this again?","Yeemay"
"Deborah Orr was a name I vaguely knew from her articles and her marriage to Will Self but I read the book because her Scotland was partially my Scotland. I came from the other side of Glasgow but had friends who worked in British Steel and Ravenscraig punctuated Glasgow as did the shipyards The industrial side and Orr writes about her childhood in Motherwell and her Glasgow but then she moved to St Andrews my St Andrews where she goes to the University and hates it.
Her parents are strict and difficult and she longs for their approval and love.
Her experiences of Scotland are different from mine My family was confident and loving but I recognise the angst,so many of my friends experienced it and no woman who grew up in the 70s and 8os could fail to be moved by her story.
I was so sad to find she died last year she had quite the story to tell","Fiona"
"I I thought I would enjoy this book but I found the constant criticism of her parents and the psychological terms she described them in very hard going. We get it you didn’t get on with them.","Frances maguire"
"What a book full of misery. Thought my family was dysfunctional till I read this. An upbringing purporting to be happy, bordering on child abuse.
Growing up in the same era as myself, I recognise and relate to the social history but the fallout for this woman is crushing..","Sue"
"While I enjoyed this memoir on the whole I struggled to keep up the pace in the second half of the book. I was getting weary with the self-indulgence (perhaps this is the point of a memoir). It felt as if Deborah had been ‘over counselled’. She used the word narcissist way too frequently. I did enjoy the parts that described (rather harshly at times) life in Motherwell in the 70’s but I felt overall the book was a tad too long and overly wordy. Would I recommend? Yes but with a caveat - well written childhood memoir punctuated with excessive and rather irritating cod psychology ramblings.","Kazamate"
"The maws a bit shan. Aye, guid.","Caroline Gibson"
"A good book and for me apart from Debra Orr’s personal struggle, shows clearly that any person that believes a Tory government understands or cares about the majority of working people is seriously in denial. It was a brave book for Debra Orr to write considering her tragic illness.","Keith Lucas"

"mummy issues but make it difficult to read","Carys Morris"
"I have to say this book has been hard to get into. But after about half of it, I felt I could relate so deeply to the author and her experience that, in the end, the book left a mark on me. Luckily, I have had an easier life so far than Deborah Orr has had - whilst also being captured by the beauty of many of her childhood experiences- and I have grown up in a different time (with much more progressive parents). Still, as a daughter, this book still helped me to understand more about my childhood, my relationship to my parents and my childhood home. Also, though I feel the author would have disagreed, the book showed me the importance small souvenirs of our lives past can help us in revisiting and remembering. It will not be a book for everyone, but I am really thankful to the author for the climpse into her past she shared with me.","Outdoor Economist"
"This is a truly honest memoir of Deborah Orr's life growing up in Motherwell, Scotland, in a housing estate. She describes living in a working class community but her focus is mainly on her family dynamics and in particular, her relationship with her mother which was multifaceted and complicated.
There are many elements within this book that many of us will associate with in our own growing up years and some long forgotten memories may surface on reading this novel. I recommend this no holds barred account of one woman's life.","Anne"

I gave it a 7/10 and the full review can be found here: https://www.2percentbooks.com/motherw...","Grace"
"I didn't get on with this as well as I thought I should. I did enjoy her descriptions of Motherwell and surroundings, industrial Ravenscraig... I read the book because, despite knowing little about DO, people who I rated talked of her lust for life (when she was alive) and her razor-sharp wit. She also had been married to Will Self and that was the thing that propelled me to her, ""what character could ever be married to Will Self?!"" Her autobiography meandered through Motherwell and her parents took centre stage. But her story did not move me, it sounded like a familiar refrain amongst many children of parents of that generation :staying in unhappy marriages, not living out their potential, making do, keeping up with the neighbours. A familiar continuing refrain. I didn't dislike it but neither did I marvel at her writing.","Susannah"
"I nearly gave up on this once and then it unfolded to be brilliant. I hope Orr is somewhere with her mum, having the relationship she wanted.","K"
"Heartbreaking, lovely, as train-of-thought as memoirs often are. Such a fascinating insight into how parents are often a bundle of contradictions - one page Orr was describing how terrible her mother was, the next how much she loved and admired her. I would have loved to have read more about Orr’s later life, which felt quite squashed into the final few chapters - but it didn’t spoil what was a really beautiful - if also sad, angry and spiteful at points - book.","R H"

It was an interesting read but I don't think I would recommend it","rosemary wood"
"Such a very personal and exposing memoir. Scotland, narcissism, family, relationships, class and university. Lots in it to relate to.","Mrs"
"An excellent memoir - honest, thoughtful and self-aware. Some startling sections on her parents’ response to her emerging sexuality and (separately) the shocking sexual violence she suffered.","Thomas"
"I don't know why I thought that this memoir would cover more of the adult life as well and moving to London - because the title states quite explicity what it covers. This is both a personal story as well as the story of a generation and a place.","Marina Sofia"
"BBC Book of the week. Heard one episode and thought I would give it a go.
As she said it was like growing up in a religious cult without the religion. A tough read","Jamad"
"This was a strange book to read. I'm aware it was finished under difficult circumstances but, in my view, much of the half baked theorising about narcissism should have been ruthlessly edited out. I also think it was a bad call to make so much of the book a complaint about her mother even if it did mean Orr could make the connection with name of the town she grew up in - her mother did not ""Mother well"". Reading the book however I was left with the strong impression that both her parents, especially her mother, loved her very much and did the best they could. The sum of her mother's failings seem to add up to some hurtful remarks and insecurity over the years but I think a fair daughter would have weighed this against all the love and care and trips to the library and support to do well at school etc and not have felt the need for this public excoriation. Win was not without fault but I ended up feeling very sorry for her. I don't think she deserved this posthumous treatment. I wonder if Orr had had a chance to revise the book a few more times, if a more polished gem would have emerged- there's no doubt she had a way with words and a story to tell about herself and her girlhood and Motherwell and class and feminism amongst other things. As it was it felt like she was focused on reliving trauma and blaming her mother for everything.I read Ben Watt's memoir about his parents ""Romany and Tom"" recently and I think that was a better and fairer portrait of a parental relationship which did not ignore problematic aspects but which placed these properly in context.","Amanda"
"A really bleak story. I suppose it resonated a bit with me because she’s just a little bit younger than me and at university I had a boyfriend from Wishaw, not that I had the family experience that she did. Overwhelming in parts particularly the university years and beyond. Well worth reading though.","Frances Bestley"
"Rarely read bios/auto bios but I adored this! Laugh out loud at times but poignant and so recognisable in others! A fantastic read!","Deborah Noble"
"BBC Radio 4 book of the week. Mildly interesting but nothing more.","Andrew"
"Raw, emotional, powerful and uncompromising laced with a hint of humour.","Wendy Temple"
"Exceptionally perceptive as autobiographies go. This is a great deal less culpatory than I thought it would be, but there is a tightly controlled subsurface fury that makes the whole book hum. It’s irresistible.","John Feetenby"
"I read this essentially in one sitting, after wanting to read it for a while. What I will say is I wish I'd read more of Deborah Orr's journalism while she was alive. In many ways her life echoes my own and I felt at points I was reading my own autobiography. There are some difficult parts to read in this.
Deborah's life as someone who is intelligent and possesses critical thinking skills from a young age is out of step with the working class community she grew up in. She doesn't fit in. Her parents had extremely traditional views that clashed with Deborah's own surrounding pre marital sex and what a woman's place is.
Deborah was brought up in Scotland's oppressive 60s and 70s while the country's social conventions were still gripped by presbyterianism, things haven't really changed for young women growing up in post industrial towns in working class Scotland - especially if their parents were brought up in such an oppressive environment.
Great books are ones in which you learn something about yourself from reading. I've certainly had a lot of food for thought from this.","Lauren Gilmour"
"A phenomenal read by the late and truly great journalist Deborah Orr, who herself questioned whether the book was memoir therapy or vengeance.
Orr was raised in working class Lanarkshire, Scotland, in a time and place when girls were expected to be seen and not heard. They certainly weren't expected to go off to university and become award winning journalists or 'career girls' as her mother would dismissively label her. She delves deep into her childhood and uncovers a passive narcissism which can run through families and entire towns, that can shape personalities and blur boundaries.
Having grown up in the seventies, there were several times I had to put this book down, take some deep breaths and reflect on the era I grew up in, and the expectations and judgements surrounding us.
I can honestly say that I finished this book feeling like I'd had therapy myself! I only wish Deborah was around to thank. A must read for women born in the sixties and seventies.","Betsy Price"
"Soms vraag ik me af of recencenten de boeken die ze bespreken ook wel werkelijk gelezen hebben.
Vooral in de Britse pers werd dit boek lovend onthaald, volgens mij ten onrechte.
Ik vond het eerder overroepen en kon me nog het beste vinden in de bespreking ervan die verscheen in de Nederlandse krant Het Parool.
Was het wel allemaal zo erg?
De auteur beschrijft nogal veel niet ter zake doende details, die soms op zich wel interessant zijn, zoals de sociale huisvesting in Groot Brittannië. Maar ze gaat daarin te ver. Ook kwam hetgeen ze schreef op mij vaak onsamenhangend over. Ze alludeert vaak op wat nog moet komen qua negatieve eigenschappen van haar moeder, waar ze het blijkbaar erg moeilijk mee had. Maar zo vreselijk vond ik die vrouw achteraf niet.
Wat Deborah Orr blijkbaar wil vertellen over haar ouders, hoe erg zij wel werd behandeld, komt helemaal niet uit de verf, net door het te veel bewandelen van zijwegen.
Jammer.","Lili Bammens"
"This is a touching and poignant memoir of Deborah’s Orr upbringing and the role her family played in shaping her whether these be positive or negative memories. The book’s sociological depictions are completely accurate of a post war period of renewal and rejuvenation of this area of Glasgow but there is also great courage in its manner of uncovering family secrets. (There can be few better accounts of how the postwar working-class strove so complicatedly for “betterness”.) (O’Hagan 2020 in the Guardian)
Deborah escaped to London where she was to marry the journalist and novelist Will Self and I enjoyed her depiction of life with Will Self, she is disconcertingly honest and self-revealing about many parts of her life throughout this book. So much so that parts of it stay with you long after you have put the book back from wherever it came.","Moira McLoughlin"
"I didn't enjoy this at all. It felt to me that she was unfair to her mother, as her father was equally to blame for much of what went on at home. She just liked her father more.
I also felt that blaming her mother entirely for her PTSD was unfair when she'd endured some other horrific experiences (a gang rape and a further rape / violent assault, several terminations of pregnancy), as well as long term bullying at school, all of which must surely have contributed.
And the stuff about narcissism was repetitive and inaccurate. At one point she even admits no psychiatrist would consider her mother a narcissist. Well, in that case surely she wasn't one!","Judith Rich"
"Bit of an impulse purchase, Hadn't heard anything about this book before buying it.
Slow to start, kept waiting for something dramatic to happen and it doesn't. It has received high praise but left me underwhelmed and a bit bored.
She makes a lot of complaints about her mother not supporting her wanting more of a life for herself than just to leave school, get married and have children and although I can understand how that must have been difficult I did read it thinking 'And?' and 'So What?'","Ann"
"I don’t think I’d heard of Deborah Orr until just before she died, but felt compelled to read her book, interested in her upbringing in a Scottish town. “Motherwell” is beautifully complex and thoughtful - an intriguing examination of the nuances and effects of childhood and parental relationships.","Calum Falconer"
"Repetitive psychoanalysis of her family who are apparently all narcissists… as she mentions every other page. Some interesting childhood anecdotes and a nice portrait of her home town but the structure was messy, the writing was poor, and I struggled to have much sympathy for the author as she (it seemed to me) whinged and whinged and whinged.","Poppy Hicks"
"I really miss Deborah’s writing and loved her brutally honest memoir. Although younger and male, my parents were of the same generation as hers and I recognise so many of the situations she writes about. I","Christopher"
"As a contemporary of the author and having grown up in a working class town ""up North"" I'd expected a gentle nostalgia trip. Yes, some memories revived for me but this is a brutally honest memoir which I'll reflect on for quite a while to come. Compelling.","Steve"
"(unsure how to write this considering the multitude of v sad circumstances but I found it q hard to engage with until about pg 200)","KW"
"Absolutely loved this book. Reminders of my own childhood. The bureau that held all the mysterious important docs We had one in fact still do!!","Deb"
"With so many cultural references familiar to me and describing not only her life but the era this was a hit.","Clare"
"Brilliant, wonderfully written and captures 1970s/80s Scotland exceptionally well.","Gillian Norrie"
"A generally good read which recounts the life of Deborah Orr growing up in Motherwell. Despite appearing at time to be a random stream of consciousness rather a linear narrative I would recommend.","Lauren"
"I really needed to read this book. And I knew it from the moment I’d heard about it. I pre-ordered it so it arrived on launch day - yesterday - and I’ve just spent the better part of both today and last night devouring it.
It’s a memoir. By a journalist - who sadly passed away last year, meaning her words have been published posthumously - who grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell.
The book touches on class, on individualism, on moving away (both mentally and physically) from a small Scottish town. It dives into narcissism, motherhood, family, pride, shame.
I read it and felt so defensive at times, so narcissistic at times, so sad at times, and yet so joyful throughout.
It was like when someone is saying something resonant and you can just FEEL the agreement and acknowledgement and YESMETOO pulsing through you so hard that all you can do is enthusiastically nod and smile and YEPYEPYEP, cheering them on as they go.
My life has been both so different and so similar than Orr’s; mine far less traumatic. And it was like reading my own thoughts at times; my own shameful thoughts as well as ones that I’m proud of. I’m not sure I’ve ever been so affected by a book.
I’ve been thinking a lot about class, mobility and home of late, which made it even more of a journey that felt so tied to my current emotions and state of mind.
In short, this book will stay with me forever. I don’t know if it will do that for everyone, mind you. But I whole-heartedly recommend it all the same.","Gemma Milne"
"Deborah Orr's journalism was always a pleasure to read, and I enjoyed getting to know her abrasive personality on Twitter in the months before her death. The memoir of her childhood in Motherwell does a great job of evoking the time and the place, from the points system of council housing to the destruction of a town when its industry dies. Much of this was so very familiar to me as a Glaswegian who has visited Motherwell over the decades only ever to watch football, and once for a tattoo convention.
What I struggled with was her returning again and again to cod psychology diagnoses of her family's possible narcissistic tendencies. The family episodes evoked as trauma, all seemed rather inconsequential and unremarkable, and her inability to see things from a perspective other than her own I found frustrating. It is a memoir, and I guess that's the point, but I wanted to speak to her, to hear more, to debate. That is obviously impossible. Maybe that is what is frustrating.
She is touched by her father in his dying days being unaware that he had been loved by others. I suspect she was more like her parents than she realised.","Paul"
"Everyone who grew up in SW Scotland in a similar time to Deborah will enjoy her evocation of those decades; the schemes; the Craig; school days. And sadly also perhaps recognise the typicality of Deborah’s early experience with men too. These parts of the book were well written.
What I found surprisingly badly written for an award winning journalist was the bad analysis of her family’s and indeed the whole community’s supposed narcissism which she came back to tediously time and again. I don’t think her relationship with her parents was any worse then any one else in that time. None of our parents wanted us to lose our virginity and stop being their wee girl. Her over dramatisation and over-analysis of it all was ridiculous and I can only assume she was subject to the therapists couch rather too much to be able to blame her parents for so much. I am sorry to know that she died shortly after writing this stuff without obviously having worked through those feelings and realising all that Freudian analysis was guff!","Kirsty Keddie"
"In tears by the end, I knew this would be a tough read emotionally but it really did get me. It’s the town I’m from, and there’s so much I recognise even as so much of it changed and keeps changing. The familial stuff was the hardest, as I suspected. The thing about being from somewhere small that doesn’t produce many people like you is that you relate so hard to anyone else who gets out, who writes, who has the same struggles and connections.
Saddest of all is the peace Deborah seemed to have found by the end, only to be robbed of more years to enjoy that peace. This might be the most tearful book review I’ve ever written so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense!","Lola Keeley"
"I can see I am out of step with the general feelings on this book, but to me it was very dull - just another 'look at poor me' outpouring which did nothing to endear me to the author. Hopefully the reading will bring the pleasure to others that seems to be the view of the majority of reviewers as I hate to see effort go unrewarded.","JoJo"
"Motherwell is the late Deborah Orr’s memoir to her past; her childhood, her roots and her family relationships are all covered at length within these pages. It’s a compelling read, one that really made ne think. There were many parallels with my own upbringing, as a child growing up in the 70s I winced and laughed at many of her recollections and I empathised hugely with her relationships with her parents. She brought John and Win to life so vividly that I felt I knew them myself. I could empathise with the people they were - but also empathise with Deborah for being part of the next generation with wholly different idylls and dreams. I guess that means I’m not a narcissist - a term that is referred to endlessly throughout this memoir.
I found it quite heartbreaking that Deborah had struggled with the relationship with her mother for most of her life and at a time when she was finally free of all shackles her life was cruelly cut short.
This is a really powerful yet poignant book, I’ve been meaning to read it for a few years and I’m pleased I finally got round to it. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.","Jo_Scho_Reads"
"I liked Deborah Orr in life, admired her journalism and was saddened to hear of her death. Similarly, her memoir resonated on many fronts: life in a stagnating, anti-intellectual northern industrial city. The smothering insularity. A mother who is at once supportive and subversive. That said, this didn't quite hit with me as I thought that it would. I understand the baggage that comes with emotionally distant parents, but couldn't help but will Orr to get over it and move on. Likely my fault rather than the book.","Kris McCracken"
"I enjoyed about 50% of this book, as a historian I loved the retrospective look at childhood and adolescence in the 60s and 70s - Deborah Orr paints a vivid portrait of life as a post-war child and the challenges that her parents faced. I also enjoyed learning about her journey through life - I think its always inspiring to hear real stories of strong, successful women brought up in a working-class community - who haven't forgotten their roots.
The only aspect of this memoir that I struggled to sympathise with was Orr's often scathing analysis of her parents and their decisions. Granted, everyone's parents impact upon their life trajectory, regardless of their intention. However, I feel like this memoir took the line of simply blaming the author's problems on her parents, as opposed to analysing to what extent her parents had the agency to control their own childhood and it's effects. I do think this will resonate with some people though, just not with me.","Beth Godmon"
"Read for book group. Hard to tell who Orr disliked most, herself or her parents? Harsh critique of life growing up in the sixties and seventies when the lives of mothers were limited in ways we can barely comprehend today. Win was typical of her era and upbringing, Orr’s memoir was cruel and unsettling.","Judith"
"Memoir, also perhaps revenge? There is a lot of anger here, and rightly so on occasion. What is particularly interesting to me is the number of elements in the behaviour of the people around her in childhood which I recognise in the people around me - perhaps it was all less individual than both she and I have probably thought, and more the product of a particular era (I am the same age, more or less). The ways things were growing up in the 1960s and 1970s is instantly recognisable, even though the place and social status were a bit different for me. The parent-child relationship is a complicated one, but reading this I wondered whether some of the problems experienced by the child might be made worse in the long run by not challenging unreasonable behaviour before it goes on getting worse - especially once you are an adult. The episode in which her parents summon her at 2 a.m. to have a go at her for sleeping with a boyfriend, something which they found out about by going through her handbag and opening and reading a letter which she was going to post to him, is extraordinary - no acknowledgement that they had done anything wrong, or that she was by now an adult and no longer theirs to control. We tiptoe around trying to avoid the trigger subjects that will set off a bigoted rant or some other piece of nastiness, and in the end it doesn't do anyone any good. I was quite shocked at some of the other things which happened to her, too.
This is an interesting and readable book which gave me a lot of food for thought. I didn't feel comfortable with the occasional disguised digs at her ex-husband, but there was less of that than I feared.","Helen"
"I read an uncorrected proof, in advance of the January 2020 publication, so I can’t say too much. Except to say that this memoir is exceptional. Poignant, beautiful, heartbreaking - even more so since the author’s premature death. I hope her children take some comfort in reading this in their grief - or further down the line - so that they may better know and understand their mother, and their grandparents. It’s tragic and insightful and I didn’t want it to end.","Angela"
"The late Deborah Orr’s memoir is full of honesty, grit and an abundance of reflection - both of herself and of the people who comprised her surroundings and those of her family. Orr was born in the 1960s and is therefore a couple of generations ahead of me, so this book actually provided an insight into the generation and cultural attitudes of my own mother, which I didn’t know I needed until now. Motherwell is a candid picture of 20th century working class life, the way money (or lack of) moulds you, and the attitudes of your community define the opportunities you can access. This resonates with me as I’m sure it has with many readers, coming from a de-industrialised city or town which has lost much of its collective identity and leaves little room for academic exploration. Orr’s experience of life as a working class student at a university full of ‘Yah’s’ was only too relatable, currently being in my final year in a similar environment.
At one point in her memoir, Orr reflects upon the feminist movement and the vastness and speed of progression. Having gone into significant detail on the cultural context of gender roles within working class communities, she reminds younger feminists like myself to maintain an awareness of how older generations of feminists have walked through such a different world to the one we now know, so that the achievements we have won in the present day are far more meaningful to those who have known life without them. This was a poignant moment for me as a reader, particularly when reading about some of the many barriers she faced in keeping ahold of her own agency and navigating her education as a girl and young woman.
I believe that the greatest message to gain from Motherwell is that we are undoubtedly all shaped by the immediate world around us. More specifically, we can never undermine the impact of our primary socialising agents (our parents/family) because their words and actions truly do define the course of our lives. For me a great deal of this is found in maturing into adulthood and finally beginning to understand all the ways in which your parents were not perfect, how their own childhood and values affected yours, and how my childhood and values will affect my children’s and so forth.
This memoir is in a sense, an obituary to Deborah Orr and her achievements in the face of great class and gender-based adversity. Every time I saw a mention of Orr’s hopes for her future I sincerely hoped that she had managed to achieve that goal. If Motherwell is anything to go by, she has lived a life well worth celebrating.","Catheryne Alicia"
"A remarkable memoir.
One of my current aims is to read more memoirs, largely prompted by some critically-acclaimed releases such as Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, a book that made my end-of-year highlights in 2019. Motherwell: A Girlhood is a memoir by the late Deborah Orr, the esteemed Guardian journalist who died from breast cancer last year. Rather than documenting Orr’s career in journalism, Motherwell focuses on the author’s childhood, mostly spanning the period from the mid-1960s through to the 1970s and early ‘80s, a time of significant social change in some regions of the UK. Moreover, the book’s title has a dual meaning, representing both the Scottish town near Glasgow where Orr grew up – Motherwell – and the nature of the relationship between Orr and her mother, Win – the latter prompting the question as to whether Win was able to ‘mother well’ when caring for Deborah and her brother, David.
Ostensibly, this memoir is an exploration of Orr’s fractured relationship with Win, the formidable woman who held the reins of power within the Orr household, much to the frustration of Deborah if not the rest of the family. A series of memories and reflections emerge, several of which are connected to ‘the bureau’ an imposing cabinet housing various objects and documents controlled by Win, a serial hoarder. (It is a highly symbolic object, an heirloom ultimately inherited by Deborah and installed in her London home.)

"DNF. Realised I was skim reading at 170 pages and gave up. Bit of a misleading blurb - I got the impression this book would consist mainly of Orr’s life after leaving Motherwell and maybe ruminating on her childhood throughout. Instead, we begin with Orr sorting through items after her parents’ deaths (the bureau trope didn’t work for me) and then the first hundred pages or so are a disorganized jumble of details about her great-grandparents and grandparents, prior to Orr even being born (which reminded me of listening to my grandparents telling me about long dead relatives as a child - utterly boring and irrelevant) before finally reaching Orr’s lifetime, which is focusing on young childhood and generic details of life on the scheme at that.
There’s hints of some kind of traumatic relationship with her parents and brother but only really a few benign instances shown (I’m mindful that I’ve got 100-odd pages unread) and some foreshadowing comments of her adult life. Not having any prior knowledge of Orr, I’m not sure if we are supposed to know what she’s alluding to: I’m now aware she was a successful journo in the UK so assume she has a reasonable profile, but I have no point of reference for any of this. The whole book is tangential and lacks structure. Not sure if this is a finished work or if she died while writing it - either way, needs significant editing. Probably people who are specifically interested in Orr, Scotland or more conventional factual biographies would like this - I like my memoir a bit more personal and literary.","Jules"
"Deborah Orr was a journalist, the first female editor of Weekend magazine and award winning columnist. She died in 2019 aged 57.
This is her memoir about growing up in the North Lanarkshire town of Motherwell, Scotland. Really insightful, brutally honest and authentic, so very sad. Some highlights:
1.) Motherwell was famous for its steel production and like many industrial towns gave a sense of belonging and identity. Consequently, as industry disappeared so too did the aforementioned, leaving isolation. It's akin to worlds falling apart.
2.) Of industrial decline, 'the heritage industry moves in when people don't know who they are anymore and have to focus on who they were instead'.
3.) Orr's transparent recollections of her mother's narcissism and how they haunted her up until her death are tragic. Narcissists - everybody knows one, and everybody IS one to some degree.
4.) Shame is an emotion often confused with pride. It's a largely undiscovered or unresearched human emotion that's so damaging and difficult to deal with.
5.) Her toxic relationship with her mother reveals how a lot of people dismiss their own traumatic experiences because they consider them too small and trivial, and also because of the 'others go through a lot worse' narrative. It doesn't make your experience any less valid or traumatic.
6.) Doing your best to minimise your own needs in favour of someone else's was one of the burdens of her being loved and having a family.
Highly recommend!","Mark Bailey"
"I wanted to like this book. Deborah Orr was one of the columns I always turned to in the Guardian as an insightful journalist and I was looking forward to reading her account of growing up in Scotland around the same time I did.
There are good bits in this book. The accounts of living in those times when heavy industry was at its peak, with most of the town employed or supported by it in some shape or form, through the destruction of that in Scotland and, well almost everywhere else, by the Tory government lead by Margaret Thatcher were recognisable. Leaving home to go to University was a big thing then when so few people went. Young women were routinely sexually harassed and simultaneously roundly condemned for being “easy”. Parents, born in the aftermath of the second world war, had of relationships with food, born out of rationing and also held opinions about black people and gay people that are appalling. Deborah’s parents and so did almost everyone else. These are recognisable themes and it was good to read about these from a Scottish perspective written by a talented writer.
But..... The constant reference to everyone who is not Deborah as being narcissistic was just so wearing. Nothing is ever her fault and she is never to blame. I kept hoping it would stop but from about 20% of the book onwards, the same stuff keeps on and on. Her mother prefers her brother. Her father worships her but her mother gets in the way. Her brother had it easy because he’s a boy (that’s probably true). She lied, stole, took drugs, had abortions but it was all someone else’s fault. Everyone else she meets is a narcissist but self reflection is a rare beast in this book. And that’s a real shame. I wanted to like it but the psychobabble just got in the way. And I wanted to know what it was like to be married to Will Self. But now I never will.","Kim"
"I loved this book. I was born a couple of years before Deborah Orr, and while we grew up in different home nations, there are some uncanny similarities in our early years upbringing. We both went through our childhood with adequate but limited family means, and attitudinal comparisons between our parents are really strong in a lot of areas. Some of the anecdotal writing resonates so very clearly with me that I can hear the words being said by her mother emanating from my mum’s mouth too. The book captures so much of what I remember from those times: small memories that she depicts triggered similar recollections in me, sometimes tiny things that happened when I was very young that, it seems, weren’t exclusive to my upbringing even though they appeared so at the time.
The book is beautifully written, its style reflective rather than purely narrative. It’s clear the author needed to write it to come to terms with the relationships she had in her childhood and to compartmentalise experiences that she’d gone through, both good and not so good. The analysis that was the result of this process was apparently both cathartic and essential, and I applaud her honesty and determination to confront issues that might otherwise have stayed suppressed. The book is powerful, gripping and raw, it’s funny in places, and at times very moving. I loved every page.","Catherine Fleet"
"3.5 Stars!
“I didn’t know, until recently, that denying another person their own feelings is the foundation of all emotional abuse.”
Declining industry, rape, bullying, narcissistic parents and a succession of truly awful men don’t normally make for the most happy and upbeat of memoirs, but there we go. This is a far more coherent and satisfying memoir than her ex-husband’s which came out last year.
Orr examines her deeply complicated relationship with her prickly mother and stoical father. Her descriptions of working class life growing up in Motherwell are so well told and she never shies away from the darker elements, giving us a fully fleshed out account of the many hardships she encountered and how she dealt with them.
There is plenty of wisdom and insight here and Orr reaches some really compelling conclusions about motivations and roles people play with specific emphasis on Karpman’s drama triangle, which was certainly illuminating. This reminded me very much of Kerry Hudson’s “Lowborn” and also covers similar social and psychological terrain as Andrew O’Hagan’s “The Missing” and Damian Barr’s “Maggie and Me”.","Keen Reader"
"Very difficult to rate memoirs.
I thought the structure and much of the writing was messy.
This felt very much like a work in progress, which I guess shouldn't always be considered a bad thing. People are works in progress, and Deborah Orr obviously was very much so.
Sad she passed away, I don't think she even saw the publication day.","Imke"
"I actually put off reading this as I thought it might be a bit brutal. It pulls no punches and is very honest but it's also very funny and full of affection. A really insightful depiction of family dynamics with a whole lot of other stuff - social history, geography even nature writing - thrown in. Just tragic that there won't be any more books.","Schopflin"
"I enjoyed this, but I think the blurb made it sound like quite a different book.","Eloise Mcallister"
"Dull and repetitive. Deborah Orr had a v interesting life yet randomly chose to focus her memoir on the most boring phase of it (does anyone have an interesting childhood I ask?? Except for like the Von Trapp kiddies??) Improved in the second half but by then I was PMSing so felt too grumpy to care","Katie"
"In many respects I liked this a lot. As a good memoir should, it describes with bleak honesty and reflective understanding the joys, miseries and privacies of childhood, and the deep ambiguity of her relationship with her parents. Their contradictions are laid bare; her father was - to her- a working class hero, a steelworker who was made redundant when Ravenscraig was closed, and who, like her mother, voted twice for Margaret Thatcher, and was anti-Labour, anti union, homophobic and racist (at least till shortly before his death). Her mother shared with him a fear that their daughter would leave (as she did), would outgrow them (do we ever outgrow our parents?) and would find herself with people who would not understand her (St Andrews University filled this role.) To try to control her they read all her letters in and out. It's painful; the childhood sections are more joyful - wandering in the woods despite the Bad Men there, or the school where there was effectively a grammar school tucked inside a Comprehensive. And for the flavour of the period, there's always the Vesta curry.
But somewhere along the line, Orr must have had a therapist who taught her all about narcissism. This is introduced so often I became irritated, much preferring her own reflections without this frame.","Katedurie50"
"‘Motherwell’, Deborah Orr’s memoir of her formative years in this town and her later escape to university and beyond, is a searing, honest and incredibly moving account of a child of the 60s and teenager of the 70s. Many of the political references and domestic detail cast me back to my own, albeit different, youth and, for these details alone, this may well be a fascinating read for our children’s generation as well. How they might wonder at our naivety, our pleasure over the most basic of toys, the knowledge that we had to make our own entertainment day in, day out!
But this is not an account seen through the haze of rose-tinted spectacles. Deborah Orr wipes away any nostalgic miasma firmly and effectively. Instead, the lens are polished ferociously and her troubled relationship with her family laid bare. However, neither is this a misery memoir in the expected sense. Orr is loved by her parents; they encourage her in her interests and are proud of her academic achievements – as long as they fit in with their world view. She is to stay at home, keeping her mother company until she marries and has a family of her own. Many younger readers will be amazed that this Victorian attitude prevailed into the 1980s. However, it was not so unusual, particularly for working families living in close-knit communities, many of whom had scant opportunity for change.
Whilst it is hard to stomach the everyday little cruelties dealt Orr as she began to fashion a life for herself, it is really uplifting to read how she slowly manages to become an independent woman involved in work that she loves. It is even more incredible to see her quest for the truth as she re-visits the parenting she received, and its effect on her and her brother, her parents’ relationship, and why her own relationships were so often toxic. Much of this is explored through her understanding of narcissism which leads on to her argument for its prevalence in the West.
This is an engrossing and thought-provoking read: moving, shocking, funny and uplifting. What a tragedy that they are amongst her final words in print.
My thanks to NetGalley and Orion Publishing Group for a copy of this novel in exchange for a fair review.","Sarah"
"Moving and all very familiar of growing up in working class Lanarkshire, but at times I found Orr’s writing of her relationship with her mum and her mum’s narcissistic qualities difficult to read in one go, quite heavy going.
Her description of the choice to move away from Motherwell for uni being unusual also rings true, as does her experience of feeling alien as a Scottish person with a ‘thick’ accent in a ‘Scottish Uni’ - felt very true of my time in Edinburgh.
Did make me want to go home and go a walk down the Duchess Park","Paula Glancy"
"Read for the Blackwells book group. This is a harsh account of Deborah Orr’s childhood in Motherwell.
The family bureau offered up an interesting insight into her childhood from the selection of items that had been retained by her parents. But she alternated between acknowledging the love and support she was given by her parents, then was fiercely critical of them. I also felt the sections on narcissism were repetitive.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"This absolutely brilliant memoir about home, family, being a woman explores perfectly the complex web of experiences and relationships that make up our lives. I don't read much non-fiction but when I do I really enjoy it. I'm gutted I didn't get to discuss this at the book club Claire is running! Nevertheless I'm so glad I came across it through the book club!","Claire"
"Gripping, touching, tragic - the story of a woman caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with her parents - who are caught in a contradictory, toxic relationship with the values of post-war Britain. Also a portrait of a time before Thatcher and a tale of how class is reproduced in the nuclear family - and of the always pretty toxic masculine. Very well written. I had never heard of Deborah Orr before and in the end, I almost cried when I found out she died before this was published. This was given to me by a friend who likened this book to Didier Erebon. He was wrong - this has much more emotional impact.","Electric"
"Feel very conflicted about this book. I really wanted to and was ready to love it.
A really important piece of history, life in Motherwell in the 60s-70s seen through the eyes of a child.
Struggled with the her repetitive psychoanalysis of her family attaching psychiatric diagnoses to them and in parts seemed poorly written. Felt its different attempts to connect to both historical and present politics didn’t work at times with some exceptions.
But ultimately feel this book was informed by a huge amount of trauma so who am I to judge it with stars?? It must have been really hard and sad to write and that was also the reading experience.","Danielle Maria"
"Really fascinating book about growing up in Motherwell in the 1960s-80s. I found the societal themes spoke to me the most - dealing with a half English, half Scottish identify, what it was to be Scottish at this pivotal moment, the fast changing labour market, feminity and the patriarchy and thought Orr used key points in her biography to cleverly segue into these broader themes. What fell down in this book for me, as seems to be the case for other reviewers, is the exploration of narcissism, as I felt she needed to develop what the idea was more strongly at the start if she was going to continually refer to it throughout the book.","Kiana"
"This was presented in 5, 15-minute segments by the BBC. I enjoyed listening to it, but nothing stood out to remember it by.","Paula"
"Brilliant, honest and ever so sad as Deborah Orr died soon after finishing the book. The book is a testament to the time she grew up in Motherwell and the changes she witnessed. Her parents were products of the 1930s. Tough and bordering on the cruel and never being able to show their love to their children properly. That Deborah Orr's mother wanted her to have the same life that she had lived is very sad. That Deborah did not is testament to her strength and sheer bloody-mindedness.
She is a sad loss.","Richard"
"Deborah Orr, the well known journalist shares the results that the parenting she received had on her life. It is poignant that she struggled for so much of her life, and then died so early, and that this book was published posthumously. There is anger, there is love, there is disappointment, and she throws her own passive aggressive bombs in the direction of her brother and her ex husband. I had no idea who she was married to until I googled it, and am not surprised her marriage was not easy.","Ruth This one"
"Well written, honest and sharp review of childhood that was difficult to read at times.","Sue Garwood"
"Kort na het overlijden van haar moeder keer Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in het Schotse industriële stadje Motherwell om de nagelaten spullen uit te zoeken. Terwijl ze bezig is met het opruimen van de secretaire dringen de herinneringen zich aan haar op en komen de emoties waar ze zolang tegen gevochten heeft weer terug.
De opbouw van deze memoire is prachtig, ieder hoofdstuk is vernoemd naar een voorwerp uit de secretaire waar alle waardevolle bewijsstukken gearchiveerd. Hiermee brengt ze niet alleen haar eigen leven in kaart, maar schetst ze ook een levendig portret van het leven in de jaren zestig en zeventig in Motherwell. Haar Engelse moeder heeft zich altijd een buitenstaander gevoeld in het Schotse Motherwell, terwijl haar vader helemaal opging in zijn werk in de mijnbouw. Toch zijn haar ouders vastberaden om er samen iets van te maken en Orr blikt met weemoed terug op deze liefdevolle vroege herinneringen.
Wanneer ze ouder wordt beginnen er steeds meer barsten te ontstaan, vooral in de relatie die zij met haar moeder heeft. Orr wil zich niet conformeren aan de traditionele opvattingen en kiest ervoor om haar eigen weg te gaan wat leidt tot veel spanningen en een diepe breuk tussen haar en haar ouders.
De herinneringen zijn schrijnend om te lezen. Gezien willen worden, gewaardeerd willen worden, daar alles voor over hebben, maar toch keer op keer afgewezen worden, en steeds weer geremd worden door het narcisme van de ander. In eerste instantie lijkt deze verandering vrij subtiel, maar gaandeweg wordt duidelijk hoezeer Orr hierdoor gevormd wordt in haar ontwikkeling als mens.
Deborah Orr weet de impact van de steeds opnieuw onbeantwoorde moederliefde treffend in woorden te vangen, en de emotionele en traumatische impact die dit op haar heeft is groot. Wat ik vooral mooi vind is dat er veel ruimte is voor alle subtiliteiten, de hiaten, het verschil tussen wat de buitenwereld ziet en wat zij ervaart, waarmee ze duidelijk maakt dat trauma, vooral trauma wat zo diep in het wezen van je zijn woekert, zo ontzettend onzichtbaar kan zijn wanneer je zelf niet opgegroeid bent in een dergelijke slangenkuil.","Beatrix Minkov"
"What a let down. If you are looking for a story or memoir about growing up in the harsh industrial west of Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which is what this book seemed to be about, then this is not it. Instead, the author uses her memoir as a therapy session where she eviscerates the memory of her parents and blames them for everything that has gone wrong in her life (there's some vague, hooky attempt at psychoanalysis and 'narcissistic' theory throughout, none of it very convincing)- except it's hard to see what they actually did wrong. We are told about childhood traumas, but not a single thing from the author's childhood seems remotely traumatic. She got told off for wearing an old pinafore outdoors, she got told off for taking her mother's nail varnish, she got bullied at school, but nothing worse than I, or a million other children, saw or experienced in our own school days. I honestly can't remember much her parents did wrong, other than being victims of their time and place they were born into. They weren't that poor, they always had a house and food, they struggled for work at times, but generally scraped through, like most others. I have no idea why Orr was so bitter towards them. Strangely, real traumatic events which happened after she had left home - two rapes, an abortion - are brushed over in a couple of pages, and still seem to somehow have been her parent's fault. Meanwhile, weird tangents get more consideration - like a thesis on DC Thomson controlling the Scottish media(?). Orr comes across as bitter, selfish, self-centred, petty and mean-spirited - which is exactly what she is accusing her parents of being. On top of that, the book is really badly written. There is no structure, it's just a rambling tirade in need of a good edit. Orr also has some really annoying habits like putting into CAPITALS words that are IMPORTANT for EMPHASIS when there is no need to, and, worse. Writing. In. One. Word. Sentences. To. Make. A. Point. As well as her parents and everyone she's ever known - ALL. MEN. ARE. BAD. I don't like to be mean-spirited, or have a go at authors work in reviews, but as Orr spends the entire book stomping down on everyone in her life she ever met, it somehow feels okay here. This is a mess, and a nasty one at that.","Iain"
"I think I will think about this book for some time as it resonates with me in all kinds of ways. The author talks about her childhood, growing up in a small Scottish housing estate through to her mid twenties, with small tidbits about her marriage thrown in. Being from a similar vintage as her, the cultural references made sense to me, and that feeling of wanting to get away from home at 18, heading off to University and trying to have a relationship with your parents as an adult. Also the references to the Bureau - that piece of furniture that seemed to be in all our parents houses, holding all the important papers that you were never allowed to ferret around in or look at, yet once our parents have died you find yourself in all the bits of paper artifacts in its drawers and nooks and crannies.
I felt for her, that even when she was an adult living her own life, her mother still used every opportunity to disapprove of her choices and that you are left with the impression that she never felt particularly loved. Sad too, that not long after the book was published she herself died of breast cancer, and never got to see the relationship from a greater distance of time, when she may have been more forgiving of her parents behavior.","Julie"
"Book rating: 4 / 5
Audiobook rating: 5 / 5 - absolute perfection
A deeply introspective memoir, that is also a great sociological analysis of traumas of a post-war generation, patriarchy, industrial Scottish town and it's demise brought down by thatcherism and everything in between: and there's a lot of it.
I had my doubts about the recurring theme of narcissism and attempts to fit the Orr's family situation into the mould of psychological theories of narcissism: it seemed to me to be trying to hard at times, but other than that this was a very good and extremely honest book.
The audiobook was just excellent: the narrator, owner of a strong Scottish accent I love so much, did fantastic impressions of Orr's mother's Essex accent, switching between the two with ease. She did an excellent job at narrating this.","dot."
"This book will stay with me for a long time, it’s a very emotional read.","Briony"
"A beautifully written memoir.","Jenny Cooke (Bookish Shenanigans)"
"This was a book of two halves for me: I found the first half a struggle but really enjoyed the second. So if you’re reading these reviews to see if you should carry on, my advice is to persevere. My main objection to the first half is that the behaviour of the parents didn’t seem to justify the writer’s endless complaints. Many people have had to cope with worse than the ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ of her parents. The term ‘narcissism’ is repeated frequently through the text. The parents were admittedly odd and flawed, but nowhere near as cruel as some we are too sadly familiar with from other ‘misery memoirs’.
However, even in this early section I really enjoyed the social history – the food, environment, mannerisms, clothing, etc - which the writer deftly incorporated. Children notice so much - all eyes and sensitivity.
By the second half, when the child becomes a teenager, my interest grew as the scope widened to include school and in particular the local economy, dominated by the Motherwell steelworks. In many ways, this book traces not just the author’s life but that of British manufacturing. She was just old enough to remember and record the miner’s strikes and rise of Thatcherism, and later as a journalist she had access to events that marked the decline of a manufacturing based economy. We are living today with the aftereffects of that decline, as though the controlled explosion of factory cooling towers still reverberates through the land.
Her mother’s final years are hard to read about, as the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood still shadow their final years together. In places there’s an acceptance of her mother and the difficulty they both have in finding resolution. She still complains about her mother, but with more understanding of the limitations and expectations imposed on that earlier generation.","Katherine"
"Motherwell is the heart-breaking, poignant story of Deborah Orr’s difficult relationship with her mother, and her home town. But this is no misery memoir. There is a lot of humour among the pathos. It feels like she is trying to make sense of her past and move on. It must have been cathartic to get it all off her chest. It is a real shame that she did not live long enough to reap the benefits.
Having grown up in another Lanarkshire town less than ten miles north of Motherwell, and only a few years earlier than Deborah Orr, reading this book took me right back to what it was like growing up there in the 60s and 70s. She captures the place and time with such attention to detail; it reminded me of stuff I’d long forgotten.
Although set in central Scotland, there is a universality to this story. Her parents, Win and John, do not come out of this well, but you can relate to their inability to understand their clever daughter and how the world had changed. That she got out and made a successful life for herself is testament to her strength of character.
I always enjoyed reading her columns in the Guardian; she had a unique voice. Who knows what she might have gone on to accomplish next, had her life not been cut so cruelly short.","Sandra"
"I found this book quite difficult to get into, perhaps it was the amount of information Orr was giving.
However as I read on I found I could relate to so many aspects of life in the 60’s and 70’s. I began to love the detail of the information and the authors dilemmas. So many of the scenarios, facts and detail were also part of my life during those years. I was reminded of Issues around parenting and the views of my grandparents that had obviously informed my mums parenting of me and my brother. So interesting to hear this from someone else’s perspective.
On conclusion I was sad to read the author passed away in 2019 aged only 57 years old. So much of her life had been spent trying to please and understand her parents. She had suffered but survived and was a very successful writer. It felt that on reflection writing this memoir reminded the author of the pride her parents felt but were unable to express in words.","Nicola"
"A thought provoking and poignant account of growing up in Scotland that will resonant with any working class Scot. As a nation we are harsh on ourselves, quick to condemn and slow to celebrate success. Hopefully we children of the 60’s have instilled more of a sense of self worth in our children (and tell them sometimes it’s ok to blow your own trumpet).
We are all a product of our upbringing but it is so sad that the author was unable to stop blaming the past for her own choices - it’s an easy way to avoid painful truths. I really didn’t rate the psychoanalysis, finding it tedious and self absorbed.
This book successfully navigates through a time of monumental social and economic changes and sadly the devastation of some of the decision made in the 80’s still hangs over these working class communities like a dreich winter day.","Sandra"
"Deborah Orr did a detailed analysis of her childhood, the dynamics within her close family and the way they affected her life afterwards. There is a detailed character study of both her parents. I found it interesting that she had so many clear distant memories because I feel I'm the person I know with the strongest memory and I like to know there are others like me. The concepts of narcissism and how they explained parental behaviour, terrible relationship patterns and populism / dictatorships are explored in detail, as well. And, as a background, there's a lot of information about growing up in Motherwell in the 60s/70s, the changes in the area, politics, mentalities, etc. It wasn't exactly a riveting read (I read it slowly) but in terms of emotional disclosure and psychological analysis it was very rich.","Joana"
"A beautiful and unsentimental book that eloquently fuses the tales of Orr's life in her hometown, Motherwell, and her relationship with her mother Win. Filled with fascinating historical detail of a Scottish steel town in a time where women's freedoms were still hugely restricted, this is an inspirational but imperfect story of one writer's journey to forge her path independently, led by a clarity of vision for what she wanted her life to look like on her terms. Often heartbreaking and occasionally triggering, Orr does not sugarcoat the painful difficulties she experienced during all stages of her life, but instead expresses them with acceptance and derives many lessons from her reflections. Highly, highly recommended.","Veena McCoole"
"I loved this book.
It was written with such thoughtfulness, sensitivity, realism and it held me. It provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my life growing up and brought me to tears.
Trying to get back into reading regularly. I found it easy to read and couldn't put it down.
A rich canvas of wonderful imagery and poignant moments of growing up in Lanarkshire. I want to read it again as its the type of book you want to revisit and reflect upon.
I have never read any of Deborah's work before, but will certainly be keen to read her other works.","JC Bush"
"I’ve just finished this book, and immediately found out the the author died two years ago. I’m genuinely gutted, because in reading her memoir I fell in love with her sensitive, honest, intelligent, and often humourous voice. She did a great job of situating her personal story in the wider context of Scotland in the 1960s and 70s. Her fraught relationship with her mother was hard to read about at times, but she managed to find compassion for her parents, despite the damage they’d done. I’m just so sorry for her that she had less time to come to terms with the death of her parents, and her own trauma. Fucking cancer.","Emer Tannam"
"A bit of a slog hence the time reading this took, I’m not sure the memoir genre is for me tbh. BUT some really interesting topics of discussion from social issues to Thatcher, mostly a reflection of a dysfunctional family relationship warts and all. A lot of talk about narcissistic personalities which I’m not 100% sure I understand. I didn’t not like it, but I didn’t love either.","Alex"
"This is an excellent book. Really appealed to me as someone who grew up on a council estate and recognised many of the fixtures and fittings of Orr’s childhood days. I would love to read her recollections of her days working in the media, given her working class background, but sadly, like many great people, she is no longer alive to tell what I’m sure would have been her must-read story. However, we’ll always have Motherwell and so will she. Order this book. Buy it. Read it. It’s excellent.","Andy Walker"
"This is a book that I will keep on thinking about for a while…it is both shocking, deeply sad and funny. I haven’t read a lot of memoir prior to this, but the honesty was quite refreshing, if at times a little unsettling. It’s strange to be told such unfiltered truths without a character to hold/shape them. Family is complex and so mysterious and I think Orr’s writing really unpacks that.","Florrie Taylor"
"An exceptional examination of girlhood, womanhood and motherhood. Orr's writing is scalpel sharp, dissecting every inch of her childhood in order to reflect on the person she is now. Much to relate to!","Hannah"
"Deborah Orr, journalist and editor, died from breast cancer last year and this memoir published earlier this year is about growing up in Motherwell, near Glasgow, in the 1960's and 70's
The book is about Deborah's relationship with her mother but it covers so much more
Direct, funny and thought provoking Deborah was and continues to be an inspiration to many people
I thought this book was great and it made a huge impression on me
One of my favourite books of 2020","Ian Place"
"I found Deborah Orr's memoir of her upbringing and youth very moving and felt a good deal of sympathy for her as the daughter of parents who could not accept her as anything but an appendage of themselves. An insightful book on tangled family relationships and childhood trauma. I did find some of her emphasis on narcissism a little heavy handed and over stated. Although once you've been married to Will Self I suppose you can claim to be an expert on the subject.","Gemma Williams"
"3.5 rounded up
A very evocative memoir of the author's experiences growing up in the south west of Scotland. It was very of it's era, evoking the estates and lives of families living in them.
There is a lot of anger in this book too. There is also a lot of trauma and experiences which shaped Deborah's life - which might be triggering for some. At times it felt like a bit of a tirade against her parents, who clearly were not always acting with their daughters best interest at heart.","Naomi"
"One of the most powerful accounts I have read of how a childhood forms a personality, as told by the underlying essence of the author fighting for understanding and freedom. Such a rich and textured account of a family, a time and a place. Breathtaking.","Jackson Rees"

"Brilliant and moving memoir of a fantastic Guardian journalist and editor.","Nick Jacob"
"I really enjoyed this - a memoir hinged loosely around emptying the bureau of ‘significant’ documents in her parents house after their deaths. The bureau having been a cornerstone of social progress to her parents- Orr’s now adult critical eye, greatly informed by freedoms of feminism, professional success, motherhood, -considers the motivations and associations of what has been kept there.
She makes some really interesting reflections on her formative family dynamics, mindful of the economic and social push-me pull-yous as well as the emotional. Her conclusions about patriarchy, and what post war men and women wanted (or were made to want) from a marriage, are really interesting, and ring true. There’s a real effort here to think about why people are as they are. Her parents attitudes towards sex do seem out of keeping even with those times, and Orr wrestles throughout this book with explanation, and distaste for their repressive views on sex, as well as other issues.
It therefore also sheds light on Motherwell in the 60’s and 70’s- with moments that feel common and grounding to any child in any playground of the period, but many things so peculiar to steel industry heyday Lanarkshire, that they are genuinely feel like another country. Her accounts of the changes in housing stock in her own life time are really interesting.
The writing is candid, and not self-indulgent - it is lucidly informed by her post breakdown psychiatric treatment. Her reflections on narcissism are valid - but would have liked an editors touch perhaps. The early childhood material is better I think than the latter parts- which become more (necessarily?) selective as she goes to University, to London, marries. This selectivity makes for a rather hurried conclusion - a swift reference to her breast cancer, a marriage breakdown, caring for a parent with cancer, a last (brilliant) visit with a Guardian photographer to Motherwell.
Interestingly to me - she writes rather succinctly and dispassionately about at least two sexual assaults as a young woman, and a relationship that comes to a particularly unkind ending. She points out some subliminal acts of self harm - on two early occasions that her parents were involved in (and critical of) a relationship, she got pregnant shortly afterwards. She does not go into any detail about the collapse of her marriage but she does mention ruefully the years of spending her Self, propping up men. I found it hard to understand whether she considered herself particularly vulnerable to these events as a result of the narrow conformist parenting, the childhood she has described so well earlier, and I would have liked to - but I imagine this last part of the book may have been foreshortened by the return of Orr’s cancer and her regrettable death.","Moore"
"I first came across Deborah Orr when she wrote the only non-fawning article about Princess Diana in the aftermath of That Car Crash. I thought, Orr? She must be Scottish. Maybe she's even from Lanarkshire. And, as it turned out, she grew up only about ten miles from where I grew up a few years before her. Her descriptions of life in North Lanarkshire are spot on, very perceptive, and her forensic analysis of how a government can destroy a community, and the consequences of this destruction, should be compulsory reading for our current political leaders. But apart from that, our lives were so different in our respective families' political leanings, extra-curricular opportunities, the granting of freedom to their children. Her love for her parents is clear; the damage done to her was dreadful. And just as she had started to come to terms with all this, she died. This book is a triumph, and a tragedy.","Barbara"
"Really enjoyed this memoir!","Natalie Lynn"
"Edit: taking this down to 3 stars judt cause in retrospect it wasn’t anything special and doesn’t really deserve anything more. This got better at the end as the author became more accepting of her parents rather than holding a grudge against them. I think she was more like her parents than she wanted to believe. She constantly talks about her parents’ narcissism but refuses to see relatively mundane things from a different perspective. This is addressed in the last chapter of the book. She holds a lot of hate and negativity in this book but again, it is her memoir so she can write what she wants. It reads well and is written well hence the rating but it’s not higher as I just didn’t really care about what she had to say","Anna"
"3 5*
Very well written and full of interesting modern Scottish History. With the author being not much older than me, there was much to which I could relate in terms of cultural references. Unfortunately she also got right on my nerves. Maybe I am too narcissistic myself to care about someone else being the unwilling victim of narcissism? And what's wrong with calling your Mum and Dad your Mum and Dad? Or any of the alternatives?
She should have quoted This be The Verse by Philip Larkin and then just told her life story without all the introspection and self-analysis!

"A fascinating read. Both sad & funny in places. A raw compelling read of how a dysfunctional family can have such an emotional affect of growing up.
The need to be accepted for who you are is overwhelming.
The need to escape the rigours of a controlling mother and a father who controlled through silence.
This book needs to be read by both women & men.
This has left a lasting impression on me.","carole"
"Really interesting social history. Recognises and illustrates the ways that different generations experience and pass down trauma. Was really insightful as well as being a personal memoir.
I did find it jumped around a bit too much for me and some of it was a little repetitive. However, was a fascinating analysis of how collective and individual trauma has effects on family dynamics.","Anna (BooksandRubberducks)"
"Halfway through this very moving memoir, Deborah Orr asks ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?"" I think this book is a bit of both. It is a splendid picture of her parents, a couple no more flawed than any other but shown in all their contrasting facets. She loved them in spite of their clashes and after her mother died, she found a whole archive of her published work, evidence that they had valued her far more than she had realised. But the book avenges the young girl who was buffeted about within her parents' codependent relationship.
It is also very clearly therapeutic although the author did not live long enough to be comforted by the appreciation of her readers. She dwells at length on the impact of narcissism, both individual and societal, in an insightful way.
The book is subtitled ""A Girlhood"" and only hints at Orr's adult life. I enjoyed her journalism for many years and followed her on Twitter. Along with many others, I was saddened by the searingly honest accounts of the trials and tribulations of her marriage and of her illness, especially her final tweets. Writing this book can't have been an easy task but I hope that the process brought her some comfort.","Laura Spira"
"This memoir about growing up in 1960s and 1970s Scotland is not what I expected.
This is my era. And it could almost be my story. The parallels are uncanny. I too was raised in a working class, Protestant family, in a council house, in a small town on the River Clyde. I too grew up with sectarian apartheid and fear of the other. And I too succeeded in escaping these narrow confines to find academic and later career success.
So I devoured the early chapters of this book, which enveloped me in a fuzzy haze of nostalgia. Long forgotten memories came flooding back: the penny tray at the sweetie shop; Jackie magazine; Oor Wullie and The Broons; wedding scrambles; warm school milk. The list goes on.
I read with misty eyes amid quick-fire texts to my sisters: OMG do you remember … ?
But that’s where the similarity ends.
For there’s a disturbingly dark side to this book. And that is Orr’s indefensible attack on her deceased parents. And for what? For being the products of their class and generation, survivors of a war and its aftermath?
She vilifies her father for his sectarianism and other ‘faults’ and her mother for worshipping what she calls the ‘cult of femininity,’ rather than the feminism that Orr holds so dear. She pours scorn on them both for their apparent lack of sexuality.
Orr’s bitterness is visceral. Her complete absence of empathy, shocking. Her pseudo-intellectual observations on narcissism (the label she attaches to her parents), so discomfiting as to verge on the cringeworthy.
Nobody, least of all the author, comes out if this memoir in a good light. But I know where my sympathies lie. Orr can rage all she likes at her parents for failing to understand their clever, emancipated, ambitious daughter. But, the truth is that she, with all her brilliant intellect, failed to understand them.
What a shame that this memoir was published posthumously, leaving no opportunity for Orr to be held to account for what is, in effect, a childish rant.","Audrey Haylins"
"Jesus this was suck-your-breath-in sharp and vicious at points and I am HERE for it - and for the Will Self slagging. Feel like she was in a blind panic to get all of the things she’d learned about narcissism and dysfunctional relationships on record before she died.
Feel incredibly lucky to have had the relationship I had with my mum after reading this.","Laura"

"Motherwell - Deborah Orr (Lebowski)
Hartverscheurende memoir over de slagschaduw die ouders over het leven van hun kinderen werpen
Na het overlijden van haar moeder keert Deborah Orr terug naar haar ouderlijk huis in Motherwell. Tijdens het opruimen van de secretaire van haar ouders komt ze voorwerpen tegen die herinneringen oproepen aan haar jeugd. Aan de huizen waar ze woonden en aan haar schooltijd, maar ook aan de jaloezie van haar moeder, de spanningen thuis, de uitgesproken vijandigheid. Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest.
Dit boek verschijnt na het overlijden van de auteur, erg jammer dat ze het lof dat ze krijgt voor dit boek niet zal horen, zien en voelen maar ik denk wetende dat het zou verschijnen al veel was voor de auteur.
De eerste hoofdstukken van dit boek zijn zo mooi, ik zou ze keer op keer opnieuw kunnen lezen. Na de dood van Deborah Orr haar moeder keert ze terug en ruimt ze het huis en de secretaire op. Daar komt ze verschillende voorwerpen in tegen die elk een herinnering bevat.
‘Mijn broer en ik waren op onze hoede voor de secretaire, ... Niettemin was de secretaire lange tijd grotendeels verboden gebied voor ons geweest, als het administratieve hart van ons ouderlijk huis op nummer 18 van Clyde Terrace, Muirhouse, Motherwell ml1 2ng.’
Het zijn allemaal best heftige herinneringen. Niet alles is fijn en er zijn veel nare dingen die haar te beurt vielen waaronder een narcistische kleinerende moeder, armoede, vechten voor warmte en aandacht.
Een memoire vind ik altijd moeilijk te raten want wie ben ik om iemand leven te beoordelen maar puur op de manier waarop Debarah Orr haar boek brengt ben ik heel enthousiast. Een respectvolle schrijfstijl die toch enige pittigheid laat doorschijnen en de verschillen in klasse aankaart.
‘En geheimen. Er verscholen zich geheimen in het leven van mijn ouders, in de lades, de kasten en de secretaire.’
Ik denk dat dit boek vooral veel steun kan bieden aan mensen die ook willen opkomen voor zichzelf en daar niet de kans toe krijgen, met dit boek gaan ze daar hopelijk toch weer wat in geloven. Ik weet niet of dit boek dan ook voor iedereen is, maar lees het vooral zelf om het te ontdekken.
Zoals Deborah Orr zich zelf afvraagt in het boek : zijn het memoires of is het wraak?","Alexandra - Alexs books and socks"
"When memoirs are great, they are breath-taking. And what makes a good memoir? For me, honesty, revelation and one that can capture how the individual life fits into wider social changes. That’s what I’m after. I want the personal, yes, but when it brings to life the experiences of a community too, that’s when you know you’re on to something special. And Motherwell: A Girlhood by Deborah Orr, is very special indeed.
Now, I can’t claim to be too familiar with Deborah’s work as a journalist, so it wasn’t that which drew me to this; more, it was what Deborah was exploring.
Born and raised in Lanarkshire in Scotland, Deborah lived in a working-class community decisively shaped by the nearby steelworks. The cradle of Labour and betrayed by Thatcher, Motherwell was also a community blighted by sectarianism.
And all of this provides the backdrop and the context to Deborah’s childhood. But whilst all this impacted the home, Deborah’s focus in her memoir is critically centred around her fractious, at times even toxic, relationship she had with her parents, and specifically her mother, Win.
“For a time, it felt like only sexual abuse and serious neglect could have a negative psychological impact on a child. A psycho analyst told me, when I was fifty-five, that it was the little things that you needed to watch out for…”
Deborah’s writing is blindingly good. She captures in her mother a woman so at odds with herself, caught up in ‘keeping up appearances’, battling with a lack of agency yet, all the while, misdirecting all her bitterness and anger towards her only daughter. It’s a distressing observation on narcissism and self-loathing, but it also reflects the wider societal battles for women then and now: for Win, her life had to revolve around her husband and when she found that her daughter wanted a freer life, it shook her to her core.
Yet Motherwell is not a depressing book. In places, it’s even brilliantly charming and funny (“We had our own sink, in the kitchen-cum-living room. Open-plan, as it’s called today.”) but it is also immensely profound.
Sadly, Deborah is no longer with us, having died from cancer last year, but her memoir is a brilliant legacy. It is an extraordinarily good memoir.","Victoria Sadler"
"I obviously should have been aware of Deborah Orr as she is a contemporary of mine. Very aware of her husband but not her. I came to this book thinking she was born in a working class family and through education - free - in the eighties she had escaped from a dying industrial area. I felt her life would resonate with mine.
Well there are similarities. Scotland with South Wales. A dying post industrial area. First generation to go to University.
But there the similarities end. Her parents felt from a different era. A different age. For mine it was achieve everything you can. For hers it was stay here. And let’s be honest she was stellar. How would you hope to hold her back?
She was also very emotionally stunted. So not street wise. Her life littered with poor relationships. Surely a legacy of a lack of love.
You can get through a lot by knowing you are loved. Sadly this was not the bedrock of her life.
As well as the personal this is a treatise on the time:
the hard “honest” labour; the shiny tower blocks and the mores of a working class. How this was so quickly dismantled - both actually and figuratively - is a personal and poignantly illustrated history of post Thatcher Britain.
At the end she had reached peace. And that her life was cut short is so tragic. A tearful read. It will stay with you and you will mourn all the other words this beautiful writer would have written.","mrsinkslinger"
"I was puzzled by the nature of this book - one quarter memoir, one quarter political tract, one quarter social history and the rest cod psychology. I found it dry and passionless, as if the author were far removed from the content, which is odd given the subject matter.
I grew up on Clydeside at roughly the same time - granted on the ‘posh’ side - and recognised most of the cultural references here. I also recognise the attitudes and moral outlook of Orr’s parents, because they were the same as most of our parents. My parents objected to sex before marriage, I’m pretty sure that most people of that generation did. I adored my father and had a more problematic relationship with my mother - as I believe is common to most young women. It’s biology. The issues that Orr holds up as examples of her parents’ unreasonableness are so banal and so trivial that I read most of the book expecting a big reveal, a denouement that would explain her animosity towards them, but it didn’t come.
I found the author’s complete lack of insight frustrating and irritating. Her adult life by all accounts appears to have been something of a car crash, and to lay the blame for it so squarely at the door of her parents - particularly her mother - seems spectacularly short sighted.
‘They fuck you up,your mum and dad’ may well be rooted in truth but Deborah Orr has taken it too literally. There is indeed a narcissist in the Orr family, but it isn’t Win.","MRS BARBARA"
"I knew from extracts from Motherwell prior to publication date that it was going to hit close to home. And so it did. There were times I had to put the book down and leave it for a day or so. So many parallels between Deborah Orr’s girlhood and my own: the relationships with our parents and siblings, our parents’ relationships with each other, being the clever one and being bullied and the narcissism. Oh, the narcissism (a characteristic I have only recently recognised in those close to me). She documents working class 1970s girlhood so well and, like other great writers, she makes you want to write. A book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come. I’m so sad she’s not here to accept the praise.","Denise"
"Compulsive reading that illustrates what a talented writer Deborah Orr was, despite or maybe because of her dour upbringing. As a near contemporary of Orr I found many recognisable cultural mores that blighted both the children’s & their parents lives, it’s astonishing to think of how much has changed & improved since. The autobiographical work of Jeanette Winterson & Viv Albertine describe some of the same ground that young girls & women of the 60’s, 70’s & 80’s were subjected to & though the writers all had very different experiences the ghastliness of the rank misogyny of the times undoubtedly had deep & lasting adverse effects on all of these talented women, who managed to shine nevertheless.","Adele"
"Found it quite a messy, thrown together read. The descriptions of west of Scotland are familiar even as someone who grew up there in the 80’s. Her parents would have been my grandparents age - and I found it odd that she laid so firmly at the feet of them, and especially her mother, as the fault of all that is and was wrong without truly recognising the limited way in which they were raised. Her brother appears to have had an easy life - then it’s thrown in that he spent a year in hospital and almost died as a child. Hardly easy. I got a bit bored of the word narcissistic - as it didn’t seem as if any of them truly were.","Audrey Pollock"
"Sometimes people can be nasty and it’s funny. Sometimes it’s vicious. There were sections of this that fall into the latter category. There is cod psychology that others have referred to. But the nastiness was about other people, particularly youngsters. She revealed information about them, particularly a young woman with mental health issues, that wasn’t necessary and was written in a nasty, spiteful way. To laugh and try to be clever about these people, as an adult, is really inappropriate. There is one paragraph in particular that was shocking in its tone, insensitivity, carelessness and casual spitefulness.","Tanya"
"So sad that Deborah died before I could compliment her on this evocative memoir. As a child of Motherwell parents I spent my school holidays with Gran and Grandpa in Netherwood Road, Range Park and Doonside Tower. At that time I was rarely more than a couple of miles apart from her. Who knows we might even have passed in the street or in that Carnegie library!
So honest and so self-deprecating though Deborah writes, I feel that I would’ve like her very much and could’ve spent hours swapping notes about the town.
A wonderful read. Five stars.","Keith Marr"
"I had such high hopes for this book, I’d looked forward to it since it was published.
It was such a disappointment, it seemed to be about nothing but how much Orr’s mother ruined her life - who was a narcissist. I can hardly bare to write the word narcissist because I’ve just read it approximately 400 times in the past 294 pages.
Perhaps I’ve been spoilt by Shuggie Bain, fiction I know but still similar topics based in similar parts of the world.
It always feels difficult to criticise a memoir but this missed the mark so far for me.","Ellie Edwards"
"As a piece of social history this is an effective book, with lots that people born in the 1960s and 1970s will recognise of West central Scotland. As a family history, I found it a bit strange - Deborah Orr seemed determined to give her parents labels, to categorise them and their behaviours, and, it felt to me at any rate, ultimately to justify her own life.
I enjoyed the book, but I can't help feeling it was an exercise in deflected self-analysis.","Catriona"
"I read this book as one of our book club recommendations. I don't know if it's the effect of being in lockdown, but I couldn't bring myself to read more than 30%. I couldn't see the point of it - it just seems to be a dreary rant against her parents and upbringing in Glasgow. I don't usually give up on books, but there didn't seem to be any compelling reasons to finish this one!","Corinne"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr journalism - I found the book very self indulgent however I recognise that it should be expected from a memoir I just couldn’t relate to the author story enough to recommend to anyone","miss ej dundas"
"I so wanted to like this memoir but I found Orr so bitter and actually rather unpleasant. Overall I found it pretty tedious and boy, did I become irritated by all the passages about narcissism. Once again, I was drawn in by all the glowing reviews, will I ever learn!","Claire Stokes"
"I felt this turned into a bit of a long moan about the author’s parents with very little sympathy for the reasons they behaved as they did. I started to get bored after a while with the same point being made time and time again about narcissism.","Jane"
"I’m not sure what to say about this book. I read to the end, but I can’t say I enjoyed it. Her obsession with narcissism really got on my nerves early on, and I found the whole book very contradictory.","Sarah Keep"
"Rare for me not to finish a book but sad to say this was a disappointment.","Carol"
"Started well and enjoyed the first half of the book but then it got repetitive. The second half of the book was marred by the overuse of the word narcissist. Everyone is one.","Teresa"
"Even if i am not enjoying a book i rarely dump it and usually skim read it to the end in the hope that it will get better. This was one of those books, but it honestly didn't get better.","Barbara Fabricius (du Plooy)"
"Na de dood van haar ouders stuit de Schotse journaliste Deborah Orr op de secretaire die jarenlang prominent in de woonkamer stond, maar altijd verboden terrein was. In Motherwell, vertaald door Theo Schoemaker, Monique ter Berg en Gerda Baardman, gebruikt ze verschillende voorwerpen uit de ladekast om terug te blikken op haar jeugd.
Orr is in het Nederlands taalgebied niet zo bekend, maar in Groot-Brittannië maakte ze naam als journaliste, met als belangrijkste wapenfeit dat ze de eerste vrouw was die de weekendbijlage van The Guardian leidde. In tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers in deze rol, had ze niet gestudeerd in Oxford of Cambridge, maar was ze afkomstig uit een Schotse industriestad, waar haar vader als arbeider in de staalfabriek werkte. Vorig jaar overleed ze aan borstkanker, waarna haar memoir postuum werd gepubliceerd.
De titel van het boek verwijst naar de stad waar ze opgroeide, maar ook naar de relatie met haar moeder. Boven Motherwell zweeft dan ook voortdurend de vraag: was moeder Win een goede ouder? Vanaf de eerste pagina’s is duidelijk hoe Orr hier zelf over denkt. Over de band met haar ouders zegt ze: 'hij kon in mijn ogen geen kwaad doen, maar mijn moeder deed dat absoluut wel, en ze irriteert me over haar graf heen nog steeds.'
Soms blijft ze te lang hangen in het classificeren van haar moeders gedrag, dat Orr al snel typeert als narcistisch. Toch is het boek niet alleen een botte afrekening met haar opvoeding. Door als vijftiger terug te kijken op haar jeugd, snapt ze de belevingswereld van haar moeder beter. Langzaam ontstaat hierdoor een genuanceerder beeld van Win, die na de oorlog opgroeide in een patriarchale wereld, waarin de vrouw zich moest schikken naar de wensen van haar man. Dit betekent niet dat Orr de daden van haar moeder – die erop gericht waren om haar dochter zowel lichamelijk als geestelijk klein te houden – goed praat. 'Steeds als ik vroeg of ik een beha mocht maakte ze me een beetje belachelijk. Maakte ze me onzeker. Zachtjes fluisterde Win dat het wel een beetje mal was om te denken dat ik een beha nodig had voor ""die muggenbeetjes"", vond ik zelf ook niet?'
Naast een inkijkje in haar jeugd, typeert de journaliste de dromen en desillusies van de Britse arbeidersklasse in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw op een sublieme manier. Je wordt onderdeel van het gezin, waarin vader John in de grootste staalfabriek van Europa werkte, waar op dat moment 13.000 mensen in dienst waren. Door deze baan kon het gezin zich steeds meer luxe veroorloven, waardoor ze uiteindelijk verhuisden van een kleine flat naar een huis met een voor- en achterdeur. Toch sleten bepaalde gewoontes niet. Zo bleef John blikjes suikerstroop uitwassen, waaruit hij thee dronk in de fabriek. 'Waarom neem je geen oude mok mee? vroeg mijn moeder soms. Ach, daar gaan de jongens alleen maar eindeloos over lopen mekkeren.'
Deze leefwereld stort vanaf het neoliberale bewind van Margaret Thatcher langzaam in. De industrie sluit, waardoor steeds meer mannen in Motherwell werkloos raken en de drugshandel in de jaren tachtig en negentig welig tiert. Terwijl Orr in deze tijd carrière maakt in Londen, komt ze aan het einde van het boek terug naar Schotland om te zien hoe de fabriek waar hij vader altijd heeft gewerkt, wordt gesloopt.
In de Britse hoofdstad laat Orr de leefwijze van haar ouders steeds meer achter zich, maar de narcistische houding van haar moeder blijft haar ook als volwassen vrouw achtervolgen. Pas na haar dood in 2012 durft ze door de spullen van haar ouders te snuffelen, waarna het idee voor dit boek ontstaat. Door het schrijfproces lijkt ze de meest pijnlijke episodes uit haar jeugd achter te laten. Het eindresultaat is een win-win-situatie, want voor de buitenstaander leveren haar herinneringen een prachtig en waarheidsgetrouw inkijkje in een Schots arbeidersgezin op.","Nicole van der Elst"
"I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I confess, I didn’t know a great deal about Deborah Orr before I picked it up, but I am glad that I picked it up. I have a feeling it will stay with me for some time to come.
This is a frank, emotive evocation of a childhood set in a very specific place and time (Motherwell pre and post Thatcherism). Through 20 objects in her parents bureau, Orr reconstructs her upbringing, bringing a physicality which grounds the memoir outside of pure memory, which Orr herself is aware of the fragility/unreliability of. I particularly liked the fact that the last chapter moved away from the Bureau and to a cupboard, a metaphor for moving on from the trauma she has endured, while demonstrating the pride of her parents in the work she went on to achieve.
Orr depicts both the places of her childhood and her relationships with her parents with such clarity that they are brought back to life. The intricacies with which she understands her parents trauma of the war, their limited world views (on sex before marriage, the place for a woman, the relationship between husband and wife, and simply their never leaving the shelter of Motherwell) and the impact that it has had on her upbringing is nuanced and perceptive. In particular, her understanding of femininity and masculinity, of her mother’s need to have a second version of herself and yet dominate in a competition with her father, and her father’s sectarianism, and pervasive othering through sexism and racism was dealt with subtlety and artfulness. Orr’s understanding of the tragedy of her parents relationship with sex, both in their lives and projected onto hers, was similarity poignant - especially in light of the sexual assaults and the abortions which she endured and kept secret from them.
Overall, this memoir was subtlety drawn. Orr never lets her parents become Machiavellian villains who ruined her life. Even while she holds them accountable for their narcissism, for the trauma which their small jibes and punishments inflicted upon her resulted in, this is given with perspective, and dealt with through a lens of the conditions of their own upbringing and demonstrates the pervasive nature of traumas passed from generation to generation. Similarly, Orr never presents herself as victimised, she is honest and candid about her own failings, the lies she has told, she shame she has carried.
I came away from this book feeling the peace that Deborah Orr felt having finished this book. The catharsis in that cupboard. There is a bittersweetness to it, in that she never saw the publication of this book - got to enjoy that freedom more. I was not expecting to be as moved by this book as I was.
A couple of caveats I have, even with my 5* rating is that it took a couple of chapters for me to get on the same page as Orr structurally and that some of Orr’s theories on narcissism I don’t *completely* agree with. Or at least I understand them differently to her. Nevertheless this did not take away from the sheer feelings I had while reading this, a book which I have read quicker than any other in a while.","Annabel Wearring-Smith"
"Deborah Orr's autobiography of growing up in a small Scottish town, with the miserable memes of Scottish protestantism (not confined to protestants) blighting the lives of many, and later the (literally) scarifying experience of St Andrews University with its over-privileged and entitled male student body (St Andrews currently has a Greek house with a number of rape allegations hanging over it).
Motherwell is an industrial (Ravenscraig Steelworks) town that de-industrialised in M Thatcher's time. Deborah vividly conveys both the respect and the hint of frightful danger (unacknowledged by anyone) that lurks within ""the Craig"", and the social devastation that its closure leads to.
All of which makes the book sound a bit dire. Actually Deborah's prose is exceedingly sprightly and playful, and her descriptions are a great pleasure to read - with much brilliant metaphor and literary analogy. She compares her parents prudish world view and circumscribed outlook to their thinking that they are living in ""Tess of the d'urbervilles"" - an analogy fitting some of her life as well. Her parents foibles, some of which are quite crushing on her, many coming from the protestant culture, are delightfully and amusingly explored (eg the bureau, the centre of the household bureaucracy, is ""never to be touched"" except with special permission - though Deborah and David (her brother) both secretly access it). Many of the little cruelties have strong resonance here in New Zealand - I guess the ethic has spread all over the place.
This story is inspirational. Deborah, who is really and truely a survivor, manages to put aside the cruelties of her situation (bullied at school, and taunted by the popular in crowd girls) by taking a Shinto-ish delight in the things of nature - learning the names of flora and fauna in ""the woods"" by educational pamphlets her mother helped her buy. Most of all, she ""keeps her own mind"" rather than internalise the punishing and competitive judgemental attitudes and group thinking of the older generation.
The bureau, like all three of my childhood homes was the unchallenged domain of my mother, scrupulously well organised and governed by a surprisingly complex web of boundaries. The upper of the top drawers on the right was accessible to everyone, full of Useful Things like scissors.
The lower drawer was set aside for things that weren't important enough to go in the the pigeonhole-lined section behind the flap on the left, but were still important. We kids would have little need to look in there, in theory at least, and we knew it. A display section underneath, with two sliding glass doors, had initially housed the best china. We both knew never to pull down the flap, without specific permission.
But the possibility of hidden Useful Things, like Sellotape. Tippex, Quink or, as the white heat of technology seared through our lives, some Blue Tack, meant that we flouted the flap rule fairly often.
A last quote to illustrate the brilliance of the writing:
It wasn't until I went home at the end of the first term that I realised one of the big reasons why I couldn't sleep. In bed, back at Clyde Terrace, I could hear the rattle and hum of the Craig, 100 yards away, and the occasional, plangent, sonorous thwang of a sheet of metal on the move. This was the sound I'd fallen asleep to almost every night of my life.
That lovely phrase right away conjures up auditory experience of the metalworking workshop.","Don Fisk"
"This is, quite possibly, the most wonderful memoir I’ve ever read.
Growing up in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies, Orr experienced a range of situations and emotions prevalent in working class towns in Lanarkshire. She speaks of class, of industrialisation, of politics, and, most importantly, of family life. Most of all, she speaks of her fractious relationship with her mother, at a time when expectations for women were simple, limited, and soon to be outdated.
Although I grew up in Lanarkshire myself, and was delighted to identify places I knew within the pages, my coming of age was some thirty years after Orr. I was enthralled by the history of Motherwell, and deeply interested in some of the things which have not, and probably will not, ever change. Orr was close to my own mother’s age, so it was wonderful to read and imagine her growing up in a similar environment.
As she recalls emptying her mother’s home after her death, she describes objects she finds and the memories they evoke. This is spine-tingling; an almost-eulogy to a life lived long ago, the only remnants of which remain in a house which once held Orr’s whole world. It feels so deeply personal that it’s almost voyeuristic to experience these remembrances, these tokens held on to for decades.
Somehow the words are painful and uplifting all at once. Orr’s childhood, the experiences which shaped her, the people who created flaws in her, and those who did the opposite, haunt the pages like ghostly emblems of change.
Whilst painting a picture of her youth, Orr makes sure to tell us that she now understands most of the psychology behind her own behaviours, and those of her family. She speaks of narcissism quite heavily, of how trauma can affect us, what causes us to treat people in the ways we do. She doesn’t blame, she simply comments on her observations. It seems this enlightenment brought her understanding, if not peace.
There is no retribution here, no defining moment of success. Orr’s eventual desertion of Motherwell never did heal any wounds, nor mend any relationships. Despite her glowing career, she never did achieve what she wanted most of all, and that’s what set my eyes to water.
That Motherwell was published posthumously is the saddest part of it all. I do hope, wherever she is, she’s found her utopia.","JK"
"I picked up the book from my library, it wasn't something I would purchase but I was interested in reading more about Deborah Orr who I knew of as a journalist /editor. I read the Guardian weekend back in the 80-s 90's and was curious as to how she got the role. I am always interested in writers , in what inspires them, their backgrounds and beliefs.
this book is about her childhood home, her mother, relationships and family structures, with some politics in the mix.
I got more than half way through and knew nothing about her journalism/personal life with Will Self, there was so much about her younger self and how growing up was dominated by her environment and mother with who she had a complex relationship. she explores narcissism and co- dependancy in relationships. Her mother who she loves and adores and her father and brother both of who she loves are also a source of pain in that they don't understand she wanted to be a career woman. The sectarianism in Scotland, and the 70's 80's backdrop to growing up are all worth fighting against and Deborah did which brought her both freedom and pain.
I skipped a few chapters as I was keen to learn more about what happened when she finally left home and went to St Andrews University which she hated.
Some of her stories of causal rape as normal behaviour and mens despicable behaviour sounded all too familiar. Being a woman of a similar age and coming from a N E community that has some growing up to to do regarding it's attitude towards woman i knew where she was coming from.
she says nothing of her husband Will Self, other than her mother refused to accept that DO wanted to keep her own name when married and her mother insisted when sending letters to Deborah to address the DEBORAH WILIAM SELF!! Her mother had the last say. Sadly died unhappy and alone . I think this was written as a therapy for Deborah.
This extract of a long poem Deborah found in her mothers' bureau perhaps sums up her feelings towards her daughter, it was written when Deborah was 26 living with her b/f.
written from the point of view of the father.
""His little girl who he used to love
went away to London to push and shove
To get a man she did not wed
It nearly sent John right off his head""
Hilarious!","Julie Jameson"
"Vivid account of a fine journalist's family background and how it shaped her. The name of her home town is ironic: the book is about the dysfunctional relationship she had with her mother Win. It's a difficult read. For the first few chapters - including memories from being around 3 or even younger - I thought, that's not so bad, for the 60s, what's she complaining about? And then the relentless destructive dynamic took hold; adding to the mix her adoration of her flawed father John and her 4 years younger brother David who became Win's Golden Child.
The complex story is threaded through the revelations in the bureau that Deborah and David cleared out after their mother's death.
There are many things I found painfully familiar. The weirdness around sex and early relationships. Not being allowed make up. The struggle to be allowed a first bra. All of it infantalising. The naïvety about the world.
There were parts which I found shocking: not just the jaw dropping comments her mother would make to her throughout her life. But the violent rape, the casual rape, the sexual assault.
The theme of narcissism puzzled me. She seemed to think it so prevalent it may simply be called 'being human'. And at times I felt incidents were being adapted to fit the theory.
You get virtually nothing of the extraordinary journalistic career Orr achieved. The parts of the world she reported on, the things she edited, the breakthroughs she made. They didn't seem relevant to her or the story she was telling.
I can't avoid a feeling of tragedy as I finished this book. She wrote it after being diagnosed with post traumatic disorder, following the death of both her parents, breakdown of her marriage, division of the family home, and breast cancer all in a few years. The process seemed to have helped. She writes of understanding herself and her history better - which should have been the launchpad for a happier phase of her life. But she died of cancer, not long after the book was published.","Ruthie"
"This is a very sad story of a mother with narcissistic tendencies and the usual enabler husband that wish to keep the status quo in the family forever in the face of changes in society they ignore. They're both quite isolated people because of their personalities and beliefs and this makes the life of their children extremely difficult.
Deborah Orr tells us this story quite straightforwardly, I was expecting a more 'professional' voice to come from the pages, but I find her writing quite normal to a certain extend, I haven't read anything else by her, so I can't compare.
It's very sad to know that she's not with us anymore, that this story ends so badly and that she wasn't able to survive her childhood and extremely tough young adulthood, that her parents made her young adulthood life dangerous by no making any effort to improve themselves and by doing that allow her to be a normal woman living in the 80s.
This is particularly unfair taking into consideration both her parents were pretty dysfunctional, the mother a woman used to be the 'queen' of the family were she came from and in her own one too and isolated from a world that doesn't accept such an attitude. Her father, someone that had endured poverty and illness, a fortunate man at work for being conscientious, but too self righteous and spiteful to others for reasons we don't know.
It seems Deborah started to have an awareness of the effects of her childhood maybe too late, she had spent her life too busy having a career, marrying unsuccessfully, mothering and leaving no time for herself. I think this is a lesson to learn, particularly in this country.","Esi_70"
"Although I really didn’t like this book it lend itself well to discussion at our bookclub. I also didn’t look up who the author was while reading which would have totally changed my experience and interpretation of the book.
Pros:
1. Complex relationship between mother-daughter. Any woman with a relationship with their mother (good, bad or in between) would be provoked into reflection.
2. Interesting references to traumatic and stressful incidents... She sometimes brushed off what sounded like massive traumas and other times exaggerated what sounded quite minor. My interpretation of this (having only found out what happened to the author after she wrote and published this..) was that maybe she was reclaiming her past experiences by writing about them. Reclaiming the narrative, power and impact of these incidents. However, it initially struck me as very unprocessed and made me wonder about her.
3. Despite really not liking this book we spent ages discussing it. Just like how I am spending ages writing this and still thinking about the book months later. I bet the author would love that - love me or hate me, it’s still about me. She has written something that is very stirring.
Cons:
1. I felt sorry for all the people she named (full names) and slated. Scotland is a pretty small place and she didn’t seem to hold back.
2. She didn’t seem to acknowledge herself as ever having been in the wrong, having contributed to anything negative in her life and I found that incredibly exhausting, annoying and unrelatable. Her critical reflections are all about other people and not herself.","Moya Clancy"
"I always enjoyed Deborah Orr's work as a journalist, appreciated her vibrant writing and incisive style. As a long time reader of The Guardian I remember her becoming the editor of the weekend magazine in the 1990's and enjoyed the approach she brought to that job and I was very sad to hear of her deteriorating health last year and her very sad demise.
This book only sharpens those feelings of appreciation and sadness at her passing , her writing was engaging and energetic to the end and we have lost an important voice with her passing.
I knew nothing of her early life before picking up this book and it is an honest and searing account of her childhood in the eponymous Motherwell. I'm sure that I will be about the millionth person to reflect on the pleasing coincedence of the name Motherwell considering the detail and the reflection at the heart of this book - mother - well - I'm convinced without any evidence that this appealed hugely to the author too.
This book is full of sadness at what might have been had her parents been that little bit more open and loving and serves well to remind us that parenthood does not naturally bestow selfless characteristics upon those whom take up the role.
A very moving and honest and affecting book - the very straightforward way that Deborah Orr wrote about some horrific experiences she ensured in young adult hood literally stop you in your tracks and only served to increase my admiration for her as a person and increase the sense of loss at her passing","Peter K"
"“There is no baddie in this story… the baddie is human fear, passed down in its doleful paralysis from generation to generation.”
As the child of two parents who were born in a similar time and place to Deborah Orr, there was something about this memoir that felt like I was hearing the story of my past, of my family, of my heritage.
It spoke to so much of my lived experience and the Scotland I grew up and lived in: growing up on the borderline between two social classes (being “too posh” in school but at university being “too poor” to fit in among my wealthy Londoner peers), the lasting impact of trauma, growing up in a family with a narcissist, the role of a woman as serving a “sexual, reproductive purpose” that needs to be protected at all costs, the destruction of Scotland’s economy under Thatcher’s government and the lasting impact of this on employment, housing and health in Scotland, the barriers faced by first-generation university students, the expectation that all of the UK will move to London and the difficulties faced by Scottish economic migrants.
Reading this was an extremely personal experience in so, so many ways. Scottish writers are still trying their best to force their way into UK publishing and every time it happens, it hits my heart in a way that I can’t put words to. I’m so freaking glad to see this Scottish voice represented in British publishing. I’m just beyond gutted Deborah Orr didn’t live to see her memoir’s success. Rest in peace.
CWs: sexual violence (graphic depictions of rape), narcissistic abuse.","Katie (readingwithkt)"
"Motherwell - both a proper noun and a knowing pun - examines and analyses the authors complex relationship with her seemingly old-fashioned and controlling parents. Deborah Orr sadly died last year and was a engaging and at times, intense journalist.
In this book, Orr’s skills are most evident when describing her childhood and adolescence in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland - evoking a time and place where the post-war consensus went from fraying to outright collapse, ushering in significant and debilitating social change, particularly in the industrial heartlands. The author paints a vivid description of domestic and social life in Britain in the 1970’s and 1980’s - recognisable to anyone that was there at the time.
However, I was left disappointed and slightly exasperated with the more personal aspects to this memoir. Orr appeared fixated with an idea of narcissism - both individual and group - and insisted on returning again and again to it. Seemingly normal family episodes were treated as traumatic events, with the scabs picked over decades after the event. Maybe at some stage Orr went through some kind of therapy - probably in London, definitely not in Motherwell! This memoir appears to be the working through of it all.
By the end, the personal stuff, particularly the relationship with her mother, Win, had become tedious but it couldn’t entirely spoil some touching family anecdotes and an engaging and insightful look back at a Scotland and a Britain that was.","Mark Waldon"
"I initially picked this up because Muirhouse in Motherwell means a lot to me. The flat part of this is set in looked out on to my Gran’s flat, the flat my mum grew up in. As a kid I moved house on average once a year, so Muirhouse was one of the few consistent places for me and now that the place has been transformed and mostly flattened it was mad to read about such a personal yet unremarkable housing scheme.
Some of the stories I’d heard already. The war vet who’d lost his legs who wheeled himself about on a board, the Sha Tin, Motherwell’s first Chinese takeaway and the grim tales of hiding up trees in the local woods from sex offenders.
It’s a shame, the author talks of the same
Pubs, clubs, places that my mum went to at the very same time, but because one was Catholic and one was Protestant, they went to different schools across the road from each other.
But beyond the mad coincidences there’s a lot of familiarity in the behaviours and the characters. The recent past fascinates me because post war Britain was practically medieval compared to modern life, and the attitudes to work, to relationships, it terrifies me, in the very depths of my soul. It took me way into my adult life to recognise how these things messed up my own parents, why the elder members of my family are the way they are. I think Motherwell would feel like a very personal book for anyone who grew up in Scotland and anyone that cared about someone from that time.","Richie Morgan"
"Deborah Orr’s childhood was in many ways unremarkable: a series of council houses, schooling, a brother and two parents. This book looks back on it all, in particular her often difficult relationship with her mother, from the perspective of a fifty something woman who, tragically, turned out to have little time left of her own.
Orr writes perceptively about the rise of Thatcherism, the fall of Ravenscraig (the main source of employment in her home town of Motherwell) and her parents’ relationship with these wider societal events. Where she loses me a little is with her frequent lapses into psychoanalysis of her mother, and her near-obsession with the phenomenon of narcissism. I felt there were two books here, competing to be the one that got written - one an emotional autobiography of a family’s time together, and one a psychological examination of narcissism.
I found the book much more enjoyable when it focussed on the former, though even in those sections, it is sometimes hard to see as much significance as Orr does in the arguments and punishments she experiences, mostly from her mum. A number of these episodes seem typical of any Scottish childhood of the time. Yet Orr spends much less time exploring her university and adult years, when she was subjected to genuinely harrowing and, I hope, unusual assaults by men she ought to have been able to trust.
I wanted to love this book, but it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.","Carolyn Lochhead"
"The Telegraph review said: ‘Take into account the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents.’
This sums it up neatly, I think.
I certainly think there was a big gap in life expectations between those born before the Second World War and those after. My mother belongs to the former and, though she was keen for her daughters to go to grammar or private schools and to have a better education than she did, she really wanted us to live nearby and to be in and out of each others houses as her friends' daughters were and as Deborah's mother wanted also. Those of that era also wanted their daughters to stay virgins until marriage, and to do as they were told until then. Me being born after the war had higher expectations for myself and my children.
Though the author was born a few years after me, some of her childhood experiences resonated with me too. They certainly brought back many memories.
One star was knocked off for such an interesting memoir because of the author’s obsession with proving her mother was a narcissist. Some of the things she came out with, yes, were this, but a lot of it wasn’t.
Anyway, highly recommended.","Liz"
"The first 96 pages of this book were very hard work. I nearly stopped reading it. They emanated unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting anger, with a complete lack of understanding of her parents’ perspective, in no small part because of the short and abrupt sentence construction. The rest of the book was softer, as was the style: Orr cut her parents some slack and showed more insight into her own behaviour and herself.
Orr majors on the theme of narcissism, which seems to reflect the therapy she received for complex PTSD. But such an explanation given in therapy merely imposes a different frame, it isn’t necessarily an all encompassing explanation, just another set of beliefs.
It is sad, though, that those conversations of validation by a parent, both parents, never happened and only after her mother’s death did Orr discover how her parents had virtually archived her journalistic career: secretly they amassed the evidence of her not inconsiderable success. Orr’s experience is not unique. I am a few years older and I and many of my contemporaries had similar relationships with our parents.
The fact that Orr broke down may be more to do with the quick succession of illnesses, deaths, financial and marital difficulties than the narcissism she sees everywhere. Sadly, she never got to live on and see that phase of her life and understanding in a longer perspective.
Definitely worth reading, but not as measured as Mantel/Giving up the Ghost, nor as extraordinary as Westover/Educated And Winterson/Oranges&WhyBeNormal, all of which I much preferred.","Helen Meads"
"I didn’t give this memoir 5 stars because i enjoyed it. It’s not a life story one can enjoy.
I gave it 5 stars because, not only is it well written, it is searingly honest. It is an exposé of sorts… the author, with pin point accuracy, describes what it meant to be female in Scotland in the 1970’s.
Despite being from a different background & circumstance, we shared a very similar life experience as girls, close in age, growing up in this repressive culture, & uncannily similar family dynamics, where we didn’t count for much. Where our essential female life force was subjected to endless attempts to squash, if not extinguish, it. Where our creativity & intelligence were seen as problematic & made subservient to the needs of others, males in particular. Where our dreams were, at best, ignored or, more commonly, ruthlessly crushed.
She made it out & made more visible progress in life than me. I eventually made it out also but still carry the remnants of those days. However, i am still alive while she, her poor body, soul & spirit attacked endlessly on all sides, is not. I wish she was, not least because we would have a lot to talk about.
I don’t think i have ever identified so closely with another person’s life & inner world- a stranger yet known. I’m grateful to her for writing this memoir- i just wish she had had longer to enjoy being her true self.","Gwen"
"This is a complicated book to read and a complicated book to review. One of those complications is that Deborah Orr died before publication... and there's no reference in the book to her being terminally ill. Another - and it is partly why this is an important and interesting book - is that most of what she is writing about (growing up in Motherwell, her parents and her relationship with them) is not the stuff of misery porn but of everyday button pushing and mishandlings. She asks at some point whether the memoir is therapy or revenge. I don't know about successful therapy - she's not around to evidence that - but some of it is certainly vengeful and unkind. And she knows that. She has her mother, Win, in her sights especially (and yes she sounds like a perpetual teenager, not yet ready to break free) but she also writes about her parents' qualities, times they got it right. She also has great compassion for them - her realisation of her mother's attitude to men, and the deficits at the heart of her parents' loving relationship.
All the rest is interesting too - the social relationships, the geography of the place. She was an almost exact contemporary so I picked my way through making comparisons. Reading this memoir and Amy Liptrot's in quick succession made me wonder about London (neither make it sound much fun at all although clearly they both thought it was) I'd be very interested in her brother's take on all of this - what she has to say of his situation is interesting. The tensions are different compared with mother and daughter but they exist. I was puzzled by her several references to her mother having had a terrible end of life and death, in great pain and wanted to ask who told her that... and why? (She was not there... that's not what I have an issue with, it's her assertions despite the absence after taking her mother out on a last trip... and it has an impact on the way I view the rest of the book)
What spoils the book, and an editor should have taken care of is the volume of irrelevant wittering about narcissistic personalities (especially because she says several times that she doesn't think her parents fitted the diagnostic criteria) which just made her sound like someone who had been gulping down the pontifications of a bad therapist, instead of presenting us purely with the words of a brilliant, spiky writer.","Jennifer"
"This book is outstanding. I was deeply moved but also grateful that she managed to put into words some of my own feelings about Scotland and living in Scotland. It's like a time capsule, reading about a place and time that no longer exists, but the fallout in many ways still does. I found myself wanting to quote bits of it to lots of people.
Indeed, I would recommend this to any of my female friends in particular. There is so much about ""womanhood"", the way girls were raised (I'm a decade younger), patriarchy, bullying, self doubt, that I think, sadly, many if not most of us would recognise.
It also talks so lucidly about class and the devastation wrought on the working class by the closing down of heavy industry in the 80s. Again this history still resonates in Scotland today. It's an important read.
Overall though it was just beautifully written. It's very raw, and honest, and the result of decades of introspection and no doubt some therapy.
I always enjoyed her articles in The Independent and I'm really sad that she died too soon and we didn't have the benefit of many more years of hindsight and observation. I feel like this book should have been the beginning and not the end.","Dawn Fuge"
"I'm yet another of the many thousands of kids born in the 1960's postwar Glasgow and Argyll. So there was so much for me to identify with in this book. The sectarianism, schools, postwar attitudes to women. Hamilton, Ravenscraig, Dalyell High. It brought a lot back.
And yet there's a constant sound of axes being ground in the background. There are memories I share - I too had a dolls from many countries collection kept in a glass cabinet. But I remember them fondly. I frankly have no idea what happened to them, and am certainly not still angry at my mother for not letting me take them with me to London when I moved on.
I too had a silver christening bracelet, which got lost. I too got picked on by kids down the road. Fifty years later, it's not my parents' fault.
My parents had exactly the same attitudes towards pre marital sex. I had exactly the same rows as Orr did with hers, but we all changed and grew and moved on. It's definitely not the main memory I have of my parents.
I loved the atmosphere in the book, the memories evoked, but I'd have liked a little more appreciation of the life chances and experiences given to a wee girl born and raised in a council house in Motherwell.
This memoir is proof you can really enjoy a book whilst suspecting you would dislike the writer immensely.","Macy Mckay"
"I knew very little about deborah orr beyond her recent sad death and the public story of the ending of her marriage to will self.
This memoir published posthumously was a compelling but troubling read. Born into a working class family in the town entirely dependent on the Ravenscraig steel works she grows up with a mother and father who seem to emotionally suffocate her. In the 2020s when we know more about mental health and the effect of parenting we can recognise the damage done by parents emotionally controlling their children but in the 70s and 80s this behaviour seems nothing abnormal.
Deborah manages to go to St Andrews University but the chapters there prove equally distressing with experiences of sexual assault and class prejudice that prove distressing.
The fact that she then moves into a marriage where she expresses a feeling that her intelligence and talent is undermined and subsumed felt almost inevitable.
What is most poignant is that this story needs a postscript that now can never happen where the author tells of how she has resolved her demons and ultimately I was left with an overwhelming sadness at this story.
I would however recommend this as an interesting memoir.","Andrew"
"My mother lent me her copy and told me to read this! I had already been curious about this book as I had read reviews in the paper when it was published after Orr's death.
Motherwell is a memoir of Orr's childhood and has snippets of her adulthood too. I found it fascinating reading about growing up in Scotland in the 60s 70s and thought Orr captured the time very well. But it isn't always a happy memoir as Orr has realised in middle age that her parents were narcissists who were dependant on each other. Ok, people might roll their eyes but actually some of the stuff they said to her was pretty awful and the way they tried to control her and not allow her to go to University made me feel angry. A lot of their traits reminded me of member's of my extended family... As Orr says, we are all narcissistic in some way and a bit of it is good but if we have too much then we have a problem!
A really interesting memoir about growing up in Motherwell and how trying to please your parents in youth can end up with you doing the same to your husband/wife in adult hood often to your own detriment.","Felicity"
"I love memoirs and this did not disappoint! This is the Memoir of Journalist Deborah Orr who sadly passed away in October 2019 before her book was published. Born in 1962, Deborah grew up in the Scottish town of Motherwell. As a massive history nerd I loved how this book wasn’t just a memoir on Deborahs life but she encapsulated a whole town, whole country; including tons of wider context as to what was going on politically, economically and socially around her. I found this book both touching and incredibly insightful. Deborah is able to analyse her relationship with her parents, acknowledging the good and the bad and how that shaped and impacted her. The discussions around trauma, dissociation and nasrratistic traits I found to be eyeopening and unfortunately relatable. She was able to put feelings and similar experiences that i’ve had into words I couldn’t find. This memoir felt brutally honest, it can be heavy reading in places and I found myself appreciating the bits of dry humour sprinkled throughout. I would defiantly recommend if you enjoy thought provoking and gritty memoirs and a big history nerd! Although TW there is mentions of emotional abuse and rape.","Laura Finnegan"
"I didn’t know the author before reading this, I was simply interested to hear more about what growing up in Motherwell would be like. It started off a bit slow but once I got the hang of the structure and got familiar with the characters I gradually kept on reading. I just wish it was structured better, discussed what the purpose of this book would be, or explained whether it would be a chronological read or not. It’s largely chronological but it keeps shifting back and forth in a confusing way, and although the items in the cabinet are supposed to tie the whole story together I was never sure what their purpose was. The objects described rarely fit the chapters, and when they did fit with a central theme Orr would add a lot of other topics into the mix which made the idea of a central theme vanish anyway. It’s well-written, as you’d expect from a journalist, but not well-structured which made this book confusing in some aspects. Still, my initial hopes for things I wished this book would do (giving me an account of living in Motherwell and being taught about the town itself) were fulfilled.","Inge"

Favourite quote:
Sectarianism, like all othering, all tribalism, is an expression of the 'collective narcissism' that found such devastating expression in Nazi Germany.”
This is an honest, critical memoir written by a tough, West of Scotland lady born and bred in the girder making town of Motherwell.
As I was browsing my local supermarket shelves, I spotted this bright, eye-catching and lovely book on the shelves and in that moment I just knew it was coming home with me.
Motherwell, a stones throw away from Glasgow, has often been somewhere I've drove through, passed on the train or seen a road sign to, but I've never been there myself, and so I was intrigued to read all about it.
I found it exceptionally interesting to read about Deborah's early life, her traumas and her experiences of a Thatcherite society and it's effects on the rough and ready town of Motherwell. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all else it made me value my own relatively Liberal upbringing, where I could be my own person and was celebrated for doing so.
I found it extremely interesting to read of Deborah's narcissism towards herself, but also her parent's narcissism and how that had greatly impacted her life as a child and furthermore, how she processed trauma as an adult.
I was so sad to read of Deborah's loss of life to cancer, but I believe she achieved great things by writing her memoir, and I'm just so glad she told her story ❤.","Heather Thomson"
"What a good book and written by a very good writer who is alternately funny, insightful, moving and political. I loved it and couldn't read it quick enough. Such an honest writer who reflects on her childhood and on into adulthood.
Three thoughts:
1. Childhood sucks - it's not the romanticised thing we keep seeing on tv and films. There are a lot of horrible kids and adults out there!
2. Parenthood's hard - it's easy to complain about our parents but mostly they did their best: even though their best may have been rubbish. If you don't think so try being a parent yourself! Get it now?
3. Such a shame Deborah died so young - this is one person I'd have loved to have had the chance to meet. She comes across as warm, humorous and real - plus she was married to Will Self who she seems to think was a bit of a wotsit which has always been my opinion of him too. Ha ha.
Docked one star because the psychological ""insight"" into her parents' narcissism is not well explained and seems a bit false in tone compared to the rest of the book.","Greenockian"
"Deborah chronicles her early life growing up in Scotland with parents who were not ready to let their daughter carve her own independence and narrative into the world beyond their family home. It feels to me that being brought up in a family of a narcissist/s maybe the lessor understood of the known types of abuse that can be inflicted upon a child. It can be very complex in that the child may never realise that they were the victims of gaslighting and manipulation, and because of this their view of themselves and the world around them will always be warped in someway. Even if realisation occurs the damage can be life limiting in that trust in yourself and others has been eroded beyond repair. The other side of this trauma is that the victim has had their first relationship in the world soured and distorted which will make future friendships and loving relationships difficult for them to navigate around - therefore they can appear toxic thus supporting the never ending cycle of abuse whilst the shame is always deep within.","Sarah"
"This book was quite different from what I expected: the blurb paints it as a book about going to university and the struggle between her and her parents, but in reality the book is more like 90% childhood memories and reflections before it even tackles leaving for university. This isn't a bad thing, as the two things are linked together at points in the book, but it's still a strange choice.
It's incredibly well written: although I thought it was quite tangential, it makes the memories of her parents a lot more interesting to read, as sometimes people talking about their childhoods for 300 pages can be dryyyyyy.
Recently I've found myself exclusively reading American books, especially nonfiction, so this was my first try at being mindful of reading more widely. Overall, I thought Orr's thoughts on being Scottish and working class were the best parts of this book, probably due to the familiarity I have with that.
This quote, from p124, has stuck with me, and reminds me why I like nonfiction so much: ""Is memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?""","Lauryn"
"Mooi boek, lastig te beoordelen. Deborah Orr kan heel goed schrijven. Het verhaal was in een mum van tijd uit. De memoires van een journalist die opgroeide in een klein mijnstadje in Schotland. En hoewel de gebeurtenissen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in die tijd genoeg aanknopingspunten geven om uit te zoomen, kiest Orr er juist voor om de focus te houden op haar gezin. Met de volle aandacht op haar ouders, die volgens Orr narcistisch gedrag vertonen of misschien wel narcisten zijn. Dat laatste vond ik soms wat ongemakkelijk om te lezen, omdat Orr steeds haar eigen ouder psychologisch duidt, alsof ze een volleert psychologe is. De kwalificaties over de geestelijke gesteldheid van haar ouders waren bovendien overbodig, want iedere lezer kon ook zelfstandig tot dit oordeel komen.
Ergens las ik commentaar op dit boek, de vraag of het boek een vorm van therapie is voor Orr of wraak? En hoewel ik het boek uit heb gelezen, kan ik daar geen goede keuze tussen maken. Daarvoor vond ik toch dat ze haar ouders iets te vaak een trap na wilde geven. 3,5 ster.","Mart"
"An unflinching memoir with no detail seemingly spared. Deborah Orr describes growing up in Motherwell in the shadow of the now defunct Ravenscraig steelworks and her unusal, somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics. Brought up by a sometimes suffocating, sometimes sympathetic, mother who soaked up all her emotional energy and prolonged an extreme attachment well into adulthood, Orr struggled to detach herself and form ""normal"" relationships. Though sometimes it seemed that she wasnt quite sure what these should be. Her relationship with her father, also complicated by his often negative judgements of her, is however described as close and loving. Her descriptions of a tough environment, sometimes alleviated with forays into nature, are terrific descriptions .The depiction of social housing at the time and the relief of her parents at finally getting housed away from the bleak towerblocks, overrun by somewhat feral children, which covered the area, is raw social comment and her powers of observation foretell the journalistic career she was yet to pursue.","Sue"
"I forced myself to persevere with this book. It’s snippets of a life of a person who has glided along not knowing who, what or why they are, but not really understanding that despite appearances we are all essentially the same! Do any of us really feel we fit, or we are ‘normal’? We either don’t realise, find a focus, or are able to put a more positive spin on the life we live. Well that’s my theory! I’m still gliding but I don’t feel the need to find reason or blame!
I felt that this was a memoir of someone sad, sad for themselves and even sadder for their parents. Interesting in places as you see how the decline of the steel works affected a get on and do generation, and then the demise of areas built on a workforce that no longer has work.
I can’t say I was gripped, or invested in any of these real life characters no one was particularly upbeat or inspirational. But then it’s real life, I hope this put to bed some of what had clearly haunted the author. Knowing that Deborah Orr died at 57 from cancer is such a bitter pill, may she rest at ease now.","Karen"
"Late to the party on this brilliant, emotional, raw tale of growing up in Scotland but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
As the title suggests Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell was probably similar to a lot of people's adolescence but so very rarely do you see a history like this written down. Having parents who are a similar age to her and similar parentage it was fascinating to hear a slice of history like this.
Her relationship with her mother was definitely more fractured and some pretty big blow outs were definitely on the cards. Towards the end of book Orr confirms that she had considerable amounts of therapy and I think this shows, there's a resilience to her scenarios but with definite clarity with hindsight.
She went through some truly brutal times, as much as I wanted to hear about her marriage to Will Self there's very little included here, obviously a considered choice. Orr's tale ending in the way it does adds to the considerable sadness surrounding her stories. It truly was an excellent read.","Alistair Who"
"I honestly don't have a lot of thoughts about this book. It took me ages to read because it's not really that interesting for me. Deborah Orr is a great and popular journalist so this book is written very well, but I just didn't really take much away from it. Some of the social history mentioned was pretty interesting but her life wasn't really eye-opening or really just that different from just a normal one, I guess? I'm not sure how to explain it. It wasn't necessarily boring for me but wasn't interesting either.
I felt through most of this book that it was explaining how terrible her parents were but they have good qualities! Honestly, they weren't that bad! They were just narcissists! It made me feel uncomfortable at times and honestly, does someone working out how they really feel about their parents warrant an almost 300 page book? I'm not sure.
Anyway, this wasn't bad, it was ok, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to many people or ever read it again.","Rebekah May"
"This was on my list of books to buy on a trip to London in late March 2020, which needless to say didn’t happen. I eventually found online a hardback copy for a pittance from a Goodwill store in Colorado Springs of all places. Given this has not to my knowledge been published in the US, I wonder at the provenance which brought this book to me. Indeed it is marked 16.99 UK only. But after all that this was disappointing. Too much detail about her childhood which seemed to be there just for the sake of it, rather than illuminating how she had grown up and her relationships had been shaped. I wanted more about the Deborah from the working class Scottish background who managed to navigate her twenties so successfully to become the youngest ever editor of The Guardian Weekend. I guess that was not the point of this book, but I was not really engaged for long sections on her brother or school friends.","Esther"
"In many ways a sad book, I think, about family life in the shadow of the steel works of Motherwell. And a sad story of a mother and daughter that can't meet each other. Although at times they must have been happy enough together, although we learn less of this than of Deborah Orr's mother's inability to visage another life for her daughter than what she had had herself. Or she just not want her to have another life than she had had herself? And for what reason; because she felt it was a woman’s proper life or because she didn’t want her to do better? She was in many ways a horrible mother, but Orr also tells of many happy occasions, just not so much of them as of the bad things. And these are often hard to read about. Less is written about her father’s dominance of the family. Orr talks a fair bit about narcissism, but I am not sure is the answer is so simple.
Anyhow, an interesting read.","Bodil Enoksson"
"A good drinking game: before sitting down to read this, fill your glass and then take a sip each time you read the word ""narcissism"" or similar. You'll be fleeing by the end of each chapter. Which is an interesting feature in an autobiography....
There were interesting features in this book, but it was rambling in its telling, and largely had the feel of someone getting things off their chest. To use a phrase that they might have used themselves, her parents would be turning in their grave at its writing, and it left a sour taste of revenge being sought. Everything that happened was someone else's fault, mainly her parents', yet with little recognition that her parents were also products of their own upbringing.
I read this as it had been recommended, and I grew up nearby, but I rather wish I had ignored the recommendation. I'm sorry that this is the memoir that she chose to leave us. Rest in peace, Deborah.","Blair H. Smith"
"A quick glance over the five star reviews of this book, compared against the lower ones, tells me exactly the story I predicted of reviews I imagined, in my head, whilst I was reading the book. Simply, that some people are going to be very, very uncomfortable about some of the messier emotions and realities of family life, and how this can unfold down the generations. I found both main aspects of this book - the evocation of a place, culture and time / and this culture contrasted alongside the author's experience and eventual knowledge of herself in relation to others - a very absorbing and memorable read. There is, of course, a deep sadness - that of not being able to satisfactorily resolve these issues in ones lifetime (her relationship with her parents), and gaining this understanding only towards the very end of her own. I would end by saying that I believe this book will help others come to an accommodation and understanding within a more hopeful timeline.","Airlia"
"I wanted to like this book - and I did. I got it. At times I could feel the numbness, that I’m sure Deborah often held whilst recounting traumatic childhood memories.
I read a review that said they thought that Deborah’s recounts were nothing more than ordinary things that happen in childhood - and that Deborah was unfairly painting her parents as narcissists. It’s dependent on how you grew up, on how you view and relate to small subtle cruelties that chip away during your formative years - these trivial incidents do shape us and I think it’s really interesting that you either see this or you don’t. You relate or you don’t.
I think Deborah spoke about her life incredibly well, articulated her confusion, loss, sadness and desire to be loved by her rejecting family, even though she would have been better off without them. I feel I understood what she was trying to express here and I’m glad she got to write all this down before her death. I’m glad this book exists in the world.","Amira"
"My thoughts.
Deborah seems obsessed with narcissists something which is mentioned about 26 times in the book. The book seems a good social history of Scotland throughout the 60s and 70s and 80s
She funny, dry humour, which is I think a common Scots trait.
I find at times opinion quite grating in manner. Though in the end I had a lot of admiration for an ordinary person disadvantaged by class & sex. Who had has made their mark in life, exceptional.
overall a brutally honest book. Sadly condemning of human relationships generally especially between men and women. Are we really that obsessed with sex? this is noteable especially in chapter 8 Crispin.
I accept we are obsessed with narcissism and our own self, Ego has always been the problem for humans.
Excellent read. Ultimately as the author says the story is about patriarchy and its damage to generations.","Rob Thistleton"
"Certainly, Deborah Orr can (could) write well. And having grown up through the same times that she did, I read her account of her world with interest.
However, there is an inbuilt ‘problem’ with memoirs- they are, of necessity, a very one sided account of things - the default position is legitimately “this is how I experienced this”. In Orr’s case this meant her writing is very unbalanced, and ‘pity, pity me’. Actually, perhaps I’m being harsh because of my huge irritation by the ‘fag packet’ psychobabble relating to Narcisism, which she kept banging on and on about.
Some people are arses simply because they are arses. Nothing to do with psychopathy.
It seems to me, Deborah died still trying to work through her grievances, her traumas and her anger. This memoir is perhaps an unfinished work. If she had been gifted more life, I suspect she would have reviewed and edited it.","Gail"
"Really don't know what all the fuss was about (maybe just because she was well-known in the newspaper industry), but this is a very insubstantial book. Maybe it is too familiar and maybe the cliques were coming too thick and fast, but she's not the first person whose mother didn't shower her with all the attention she wanted and I'm sure she won't be the last.
This was promoted as a wonderful, ground breaking book, but it just felt like everything good that happened in her life was despite her mother, while everything bad was because of her. Orr's father is portrayed as being less than a saint with his discriminatory views, but it sounds like Deborah Orr got a therapist to explain her life to her, and she went with it.
On the plus side, there were some things given a historical context but this felt like score settling with dead people.

"Deborah Orr overleed in 2019 en was journalist voor The Guardian en The Independent, twee kranten die ik in mijn anglofiele fase erg graag las. Ik vermoed dat ik daardoor deze memoires meenam uit de boekhandel. En verder ook de beloftevolle zin: ""Pas nu kan ze duidelijk zien hoe disfunctioneel haar familie was, en hoe allesbepalend de invloed van haar moeder op de rest van haar leven is geweest."" Die disfunctionaliteit wordt verklaard door het narcisme waarvan haar familie doorspekt is. Een halfslachtige analyse wordt dat uiteindelijk - 'Always blame the parents', niet waar? - die me niet kon overtuigen. Restte mij nog: meer te weten te komen over het leven in Schotland onder Thatcher. En daar scheelde de mismatch tussen het boek en mezelf dan weer aan mijn te gebrekkige kennis over die periode. Te weinig aanknopingspunten waardoor het lezen worstelen werd.","Minnie Vos"
"I'll get this out of the way: my only criticism was my having to re-read snippets due to sentence structure but I reckon that's due to the author having written as it would have been vocalised; something I do!
I found this so moving. So many parallels between Deborah Orr's family experience and mine. The book revolves around the passing of her parents and the clearing of their home by her and her brother. Memories, childhood, reflection on her and her parents' character and drives. The narrative on narcissism running through the book was insightful. An added engagement were detailed descriptions relating to the demise of industry in Motherwell, her home town under the Tory government in the eighties and the devastating impact on individual lives and communities.
Reading this now, it is so sad as she must have died shortly after writing.","Paul Clarkson"
"I found this to be a profoundly sad book, and a moving reminder of the way in which remarks, attitudes, controlling and coercive behaviours from parents we love can carve so deeply into our core. It evokes very clearly a time and a place, a way of being many of us did not question until our teens, prompting a severance from which we never truly return.
It is by no means a great book; it is crying out for some editorial input especially around the repetitive reference to narcissism. I would also have liked to know more about how these experiences shaped her later life and relationships. Presumably her early death is the main reason for the absence of both. In the absence of a longer period of reflection and - I’d like to think - happiness - it is the emotional rawness of her residual trauma that causes me to feel a great sympathy for her.","cydell"
"""Raving reviews"", zoals de Engelsen zeggen, maar ik ben maar matig enthousiast over deze memoires van Deborah Orr. Het staat bijvoorbeeld vol met ellenlange nutteloze beschrijvingen van ""dingen"" die helemaal niet van belang zijn voor het verhaal, en echt goede dialogen of weergaves van gesprekken in haar leven ontbreken veelal. Daarnaast gebruikt ze geloof ik voor iedereen met wie ze gebrouilleerd heeft het woord ""narcist"". Haar ouders zijn narcisten, haar exen zijn allemaal narcisten en de inwoners van Motherwell: allemaal narcisten. Nergens keert ze naar binnen en gaat ze bij zichzelf te rade over waarom ze dat zo ervaart, waar die harde oordelen vandaan komen, of ze wel kloppen. Er zijn in het boek eigenlijk geen mensen over wie ze liefdevol schrijft, en dat maakt het nogal taaie kost.","Joyce"
"Such an interesting book this one. I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever been to Motherwell and really all I know about it is that they have a football team and that they used to make steel! Which is what she says most folk say in the book! Some funny moments in the book and lots of memories as she is a couple of years younger than me so when she talks about her childhood and toys and magazines or comics that she used to have/read, it was very similar to my childhood! Fascinating bits about narcissism and disassociation which was very interesting. She had quite a difficult life it seemed to me and quite a few nasty things happened to her and her relationship with her parents was fraught to say the least. Definitely worth a read though.","Jane Watson"
"I really, really wanted to like this book but I just found it incredibly narcissistic, and well, a bit bleak.
Whilst I admire her vulnerability for opening up about her childhood, I feel like the whole book was dedicated to slating her parents for their choices - especially her mum. I'm just not sure what the reader is supposed to get out of the book, other than to not be so bitter about things out of your control or to not spend a life so enraged...
I also found her writing style to be massively messy, and I didn't like the fact that she would jump from her childhood to adulthood within one chapter, as it only complicated things.
All in all, a 2/5 but only because I managed to finish it.","Bekki (bekkis.bookshelf)"
"This is one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Deborah Orr was a Guardian journalist and died in 2020 aged 57 of breast cancer. I’d read some of her columns before but didn’t know a great deal about her other than she’d been married to the author Will Self.
The author writes movingly of her Motherwell childhood in the 1960s and 1970s. Her mum and dad were working class and wanted Deborah to get married and be a home maker like Win, Deborah’s mum had been. Deborah had other ideas and wanted university, sexual freedom and a career.
I recognised many of the sectarian divides Deborah describes, also the Scottish school system was familiar to me as I am only four years younger. I’d like to write a memoir as funny, heartbreaking and moving as this.","Sue Barbosa"
"I've wanted to read this book for a while and I'm so glad that have now.
Motherwell is the story of Deborah Orr's upbringing in Motherwell and how the town and her family, especially her mother, shaped her life.
Her writing has a rawness about it that entirely suits the story. There are parts that are shockingly sad, that will leave you shaking your head but there are also parts that are laugh out loud. In many ways it's the contrast of the happiness and the sadness that make it such an excellent read.
For me personally, being brought up in Edinburgh there were so many parts of her Scottish childhood that I recognised. I could still happily eat a jeely piece now!
An excellent read that I would recommend.","Fiona Dinwoodie"
"I saw this book stocked in numerous Waterstones stores and having relations who once resided in the surrounding boroughs to Motherwell this book really caught my interest. It reads like a literacy essay on Motherwell and the social and political issues the author grew up with in her childhood during the 1970s and 1980s during Thatcher's reign - from the milk cartons being taken away from primary schools, the eleven plus exam to the author's personal experiences with narcism. I liked how at one stage New Lanark gets a mention too and the social housing system at the time during the seventies and eighties. I fully recommend the read if you are into social and political issues and the history of areas in Scotland post industrial revolution.","Sam"
"I love Deborah's voice - clear, intelligent, compassionate. I think she really conveys an understanding of the social climate of her families upbringing and a love/respect of the natural beauty of where she grew up. Some of the experiences she went through were shocking but almost everyday (every woman) in the sense of how they fit within a patriarchal and traditional Scottish society. I was absorbed in her story and cheering her on. My only criticism would be her overuse of the term narcissism and using it to explain the psychology of her family and any difficult character that she became involved with. I think the book is also a love/hate story to her parents. I was sad to read that she has died and I will definitely be looking up her journalistic work/articles.","Hannah Mueller"
"Having grown up in a very similar time (although a completely different place) to the author, I found a lot of resonance in this book. It was interesting to hear about how different life was in a different place too. It wasn’t a particularly gripping or enjoyable read though and although the author obviously did very well in her life there was very little of her climb out of a pretty depressingly awful childhood to give balance to the read. It felt like quite a self indulgent book, and whilst I admire the honesty it felt like quite a voyeuristic read. By the time I reached the end of the book I’d also forgotten why she loved her dad so much, though I imagine that was revealed in the early part. I couldn’t be bothered to go back and reread.","Christine"
"Tough to rate, would have given 2.5 stars if I could have. This title popped up a few times in my search for mid 20th century British working class non fiction, gave it a read despite the many somewhat negative comments.
It's not that it was poorly written, it isn't, it's just that it really isn't a typical memoir (and there really is nearly no tie in to the working class society that I was looking for). It reads like it was a form of therapy for the author who had a very difficult relationship with her parents. I mean, it was really dragged out, gone over, back and forth, over and over again.
I hope it was cathartic for her. I hope she found some peace. Unfortunately she passed away before this was published, from a recurrence of breast cancer.","Alexa"
"Deborah Orr left her life on paper, her childhood, teenage and adult years open and bare. The natural angst as you grow and become something that your parents can’t control, the life your parents lived and experienced that imbues their every action of parenting and as child makes no sense. Deborah’s life is forever coloured by her parents, free at fifty and yet suffering, trying to please, never quite feeling enough. A book where we can all recognise the angst of childhood, of not wanting what our parents want for us, feeling trapped, breaking free, and, it still not being a right or happy life.
Orr writes from the very pit of her stomach and the love in her heart.","Rebecca B - What Rebecca Read Next"
"The honesty/frankness the author uses when reflecting on her family was at times challenging as it wasn't the classic examples of a negative relationship I've come to expect perhaps in biographies.
Throughout the book she reflects on societal expectations, cultural influences and shifting value systems and how these impacted at a personal & family level. She reflects on the changing perspectives of parents, family stories and childhood as she grew up. I found sections really thought provoking and interesting with universal truths and an insight into a time and place in history I've not thought much about before. I would therefore recommend this book.","Eileen"
"I loved this book, a brilliant page turner, poignant, moving, a roller coaster of emotions, not least the fact that this book was published very shortly after Deborah Orr's untimely death in October 2019. I could relate to a lot of the trials and tribulations of growing up in the sixties and seventies, the family politics and related emotional roller coaster that is part and parcel of growing up in families that are stuck in their own world. Narcissism rears its ugly head on many occasions, parents stuck in a time warp and entrenched in ideals and moral values that make life so unnecessarily difficult. I'll never forget Deborah and I'll never forget this book.","Anastasia Georgiou"
"This was raw and very painful in parts, with its honest account of parents who mean well and love you but have traumatised you and ruined your life (especially your emotional life) nonetheless without actually doing anything actually criminal, so you can’t even feel that it was their fault and have to blame yourself instead.
Reviews I saw tended to focus on the political angle, with the destruction of the steel industry and the shafting of working class strivers during the Thatcher years, but for me it was all about growing up as a clever girl in a patriarchal household with totally controlling parents.
Poor Deborah, too—dying just as she was finally working out how to live. RIP.","Elizabeth Eva"
"This is a well written book no doubt about it. Deborah Orr has a deft touch and many a great turn of phrase. Her portrait of growing up in a bleak Scottish estate was vivid and at times touching.
Personally though, I didn't warm to her as a narrator. Felt her to be very cold and clinical and possessing more than a touch of arrogance.
I tend to judge books by how they left me feeling and despite the technical excellence of her writing and the sociologically interesting topic, I struggled to finish this book and ultimately found it depressing. Did read it during first lockdown of 2020, so that probably didn't help!","Anna Mc"
"Journalist Deborah Orr's memoir is an evocative time capsule of 70s Scotland, and the depictions of family life in Motherwell with her strait-laced parents is frank and caustically witty. She has a brilliant eye for detail, picking out telling objects, sounds or feelings that bring her memories to life. She also has a fury that drips from the page when she steps out of the past to psychoanalyse 'narcissistic people' (ostensibly her mother, but in reality, I'm sure, in reference to her ex-husband Will Self). Orr died from cancer in 2019, sadly before publication date. The book remains a vivid legacy.","Carolyn Drake"
"Self deprecating, Orr writes about her early childhood raised in a council house in the heart of the UK Steel Industry during the 1960's - 1980's. She negotiates memories of school, friendships, money but mostly her parent's relationship. Her parents were pretty strong providing constant love and affection and never denying the two young Orrs the resources they needed. My impression is that this was a family of strong personalities and those personalities would inevitably clash. To have progressed as far as she did was a major achievement and I am glad that I could read about it in her Memoir, Motherwell by Deborah Orr.","Kate"
"Having been brought up in the 60s in a town dominated by a huge steel-making plant, I was attracted to this memoir. As well as the location I was able to relate to Win who bore very similar traits to my mother. Orr’s deconstruction of her mother’s narcissistic personality was interesting but I feel it was sometimes harsh and that Win was just a typical provincial woman of her time, who struggled to assimilate the drastic contemporary social changes.
Despite Orr’s standing as a journalist, I found some of her grammar and style somewhat wanting. However there were equally some well constructed passages of social commentary.","Isobel"
"My family hailing from a mining town I recognised a lot of the effects of deindustrialisation on the communities whose life blood are the mines.
The Freudian views were not my thing, but if it helped the author again a clearer understanding of her situation that is all for the better.
This autobiography manages to be at the same time intensely tragic (relationship to parents,sexual abuse including being raped about five times) and funny (""With those exam results you can do ANYTHING! Nurse OR teacher!!!"").","Mothwing"
"I enjoyed reading this book and took great pleasure in those ""ah yes, I remember that ..."" moments (of which there were many) in the book. In this respect it is a fine memoir. Part way through the book Orr asks ""is memoir therapy, or is it vengeance?"" For me this demonstrated an alternative thread running through the book. I appears that Orr had a difficult relationship with her parents, in particular her mother. I found myself wondering what lay behind the writing; really is it theraoy for Orr or vengeance on her mother?","Angela"
"I was sceptical about reading this at first as I sometimes found Deborah’s writing (especially on twitter) quite abrasive. This is a brutally honest but beautifully written account of her life and the people and events which shaped it.
Her writing style is so clear, evocative and engaging.
Even when talking about difficult things you never get the sense that she’s talking out of pity or revenge despite having every right to. She’s just telling her story, warts and all.
Such a shame she didn’t get to see the responses.","Rachel Williams"
"Having been a fan of Orr’s journalism and saddened by her death, I eagerly anticipated a full volume of her writing. Unfortunately I found this distinctly average. Notwithstanding the occasionally acute social observation and pithy asides, the memoir mainly read as a ranting catharsis about a fairly average childhood (who has an entirely functional relationship with their parents?).
More interesting - and disturbing - were the university chapters. I can’t help but think the record of the next years of her life would have had greater merit but sadly this will not be.","Eliza"
"A vivid, honest memoir, that captures both a family dynamic and a way of life in a particular place in a particular era. It also captures the painful disjunction that Orr experienced between the family she grew up in and the professional world she came to be a part of. I am glad for Orr's own sake that she was able to write and publish this book before her death, as it is her way of 'owning' her own history, and working through trauma. Her wide application of the term 'narcissism' was not always entirely convincing, but it was clearly a concept that helped her make sense of her life.","Chimene Bateman"
"I loved Deborah Orr's journalism and her memoir is equally strong - Orr doesn't flinch from honest and searching accounts of her own behaviour and her family, particularly her mother. There is a sense of not letting herself - or anyone else - off the hook, in service of some kind of truth. It's a portrait of a vanished moment in Scottish history as well - the closure of the Craig, the stifling and oppressive nature of life in small-town lowland industrial Scotland, and the optimism of change, especially for women.
I wish Orr was still around.","Belinda Weir"
"I found this a hard book the give a rating. Mainly due to the fact that the author died and I didn't know much about her before. It is a good 3 not a negative 3. It is well written and engaging, I do feel a lot of the shocking stuff was let towards the end. Also a minor criticism is you ask yourselves wh=ere her parents that bad or maybe just being parents they were not always perfect but had faults like we all do. To be fair to her she does say that in her own way.
It was a good memoir, I didnt love it I liked it a lot","Grant"
"I give it a 4.5. The writing is excellent and she (the author) evokes the time and place so well. Some of her experiences are shocking and others funny/ emotional. It’s particularly poignant to read knowing that she died so soon after writing this book.
The difficulty I have, which I see I share with others, is in the portrayal of her mother as a narcissist. There’s is clearly a conflict in how she feels about her mother and in trying to resolve this she comes back time and again to this topic. It’s provides a distraction in an otherwise excellent read.","Emma Guthrie"
"Beautifully written, but at times a painful read.
Orr’s an outstanding writer, and her memoir built around the items she discovered in her parents’ bureau after her mother’s death is an interesting structure.
Her gaze is clear, hard and often brutal. “Is a memoir therapy? Or revenge?”
There were elements of both. Holding simultaneously her conflicting images (as we all do) of her parents - the wonderful loving father, the racist sexist bigot. The cruel narcissistic mother and the woman who plays on the carpet, sings songs and watches childrens telly cuddling her kids.","Jay"
"Heard about this book last year and was intrigued to read a memoir about someone growing up in a Scottish town.
There was a lot to like about this book - there were many relatable anecdotes of growing up in a council area to working class parents. However, I found the author to be very unlikeable and the book was extremely self indulgent (I get it’s a memoir but everything that happened was EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT).
An interesting insight into 70’s/80’s Motherwell but I would have liked her to delve deeper into class and social situations rather than absolute drivel about nail varnish.","Ceri"
"Deborah Orr has had such a fascinating life, and I was so excited to read her account of growing up, particularly given her working class background. But I really struggled to get into this book, I found the way it was written difficult to follow. There was also an ongoing theme of bitterness throughout the book, aimed at her parents, and I feel that this was unnecessary given the explanations she gave for what happened in her childhood which gave the reader enough of an insight. Interesting read for fan’s of her work but otherwise I would not recommend.","Eleanor Jones"
"Interesting themes and ideas - exploring class, gender, and industrial decline in the West Coast of Scotland. The form of memoir was punctuated by high-level opinions, indicating Orr’s columnist sensibility, and psychoanalytical commentary (she mentions having participated in therapy) about family dynamics, and wider cultural issues. I respect that Orr wrote the book she needed to write, and clearly a lot of processing happened through the endeavour. However, the voice (columnist/memoirist/psychoanalytical commentator) wasn’t for me.","mindy"
"This story, so honest, insightful and identifiable, what it is to be a girl, a young woman, the complexity of clashing female ways, of generation, of not knowing what love is or how to show it. And then specific, to her story, working class, Glasgow and being smart, a spotlight shone on some of Britains cultural ways surrounding that. I read this always with a huge sadness, knowing that Deborah Orr had died before she was able to see the publication or read at the launch.","Jo Stones"
"A childhood memoir that clearly has taken a lifetime of considered and agonising thought from the late author, that leaves one with a great feeling of sadness for things left unsaid and relationships lost in time. The fallen splendour of late 70s Motherwell laid bare by a failing steel industry is perfect for the complex, failing mother and daughter relationship central to this book. Dark, gritty and heartfelt in equal measures.","Paul Kerr"
"As an ex Motherwell girl I can relate to some of her thoughts on life in the town, but not to others, but hey, it's not my story.
I liked 'some' of the town descriptions, the one small section where she wrote in the 'accent' was a bit annoying. Her relationship with her mum was obviously very damaging, maybe a cathartic process for her. She survived some horrific events. Sad to hear of her passing, which undoubtedly was why I read this book in the first place.","Ann-marie"
"The story is familiar: a clever working-class child moves up and away from her suffocating family. It's been a theme we encounter often in western literature, certainly until generation X, to which the author belongs. The main value of the book lies in the dispassionate tone of the narration, despite the parents' infuriating inability to adjust and mellow with age. It's good not to have a happy ending in such a tale.","Alexander Van Leadam"
"Too unstructured to be able to keep track and persistent use of “anyway...” which I don’t like! The narcissism theme throughout the book didn’t hit home for me as it felt the author didn’t explain how she had come to learn about this or was able to speak so authoritatively on the subject. Having said that, I loved her scene setting of the working class mining community which invoked lovely memories of my grandparents in the North East.","Daisy Kell-Jones"
"Interesting memoir. The author, now deceased, looks back on her childhood and growing up in Motherwell, Scotland and it is a largely negative outlook blaming her parents for being narcissistic and seeing herself as a victim of a traditional upbringing. As it’s her story, very one sided. I see lots of her complaints as coming from tradition not so much from being a narcissist? Still, interesting read, mostly because of a story of Motherwell and working class in post war Britain.","Agnieszka Higney"
"This was more about Orr's relationship with her mother than I expected.
As a woman from the west of Scotland I enjoyed the reflections on the demise of the communities of the hard industries in the late 20th century.
There was lots to identify with in Orr's sharp memories of the intricacies of lives in that period. I also felt her sense of detachment and otherness returning to her old abode.
It is well written and reminds us of the sad loss of a great writer of her time.","Sarah Hamilton"
"I enjoyed Deborah Orr's account of growing up in the sixties and seventies as I also grew up then and can relate to many of her experiences. I am thankful that, unlike Orr's, my working class parents encouraged me in my wish to go to university and later move away for employment.
This is an interesting and thought provoking read. I don't think Orr's reflections on narcissism added anything though.","Angela Leivesley"
"This is a stunning memoir, it is difficult to read at times. There is great emotional depth to the book. The book details family dynamics and the effect on subsequent adult relationships. The author has great love for her family and home town. As she recognises negative behaviour later in her life she untangles the source of her emotional history. A worthy read and Ms. Orr is a great loss to the world.","Regina Dooley"
"Not an easy read but I find myself constantly thinking about her story, despite finishing the book a few weeks ago. Deborah Orr was born a year after me and so there were elements that resonated, but far more that were alien to me. I admired her determination to escape from her designated path.
Ultimately it was a sad and heart-wrenching read. I have read some of her columns so I know that there were good moments in her life, they did not take place during her girlhood.","Amanda"
"It's all a bit relentlessly bleak, to be honest. I did sympathise a great deal with Orr - her childhood sounds brutal and her family were clearly toxic - but at a certain point I also felt frustrated with her for allowing her parents to shape so much of her life. I also wish she hadn't decided to make this book so grim; while I respect her honesty, it would have been much more readable if there were a few more flashes of joy in the book, even if it was only that she eventually escaped.","Coepi"
"I often read memoirs written by people I’ve never heard of. This doesn’t mean they’re not famous but just that I wasn’t aware of them. Motherwell is the Scottish town where author, Deborah Orr, lived. Stories like this are so frustrating because when describing their earlier lives, hellish at best, you can understand that they had no way out, no way of coping, no way of escaping their parents. Orr really helps the reader better understand narcissism. It’s unfortunate it took her so long….","Carla"
"I loved this book. If anyone ever wanted to know how a smart, seemingly capable woman can end up in a disastrously abusive relationship, and what the impact of dysfunctional parents is, look no further. Deborah Orr sounds like a wonderful, interesting woman I would have loved to have met. You can't help thinking though, that the narcissism label she uses so liberally is unfairly placed on herself - it's as if she had to somehow apologise for sharing her painful stories, like they didn't belong to her. It's heartbreaking to know that she didn't live to see her book published.","Kirstie Hawkins"
"Took me a while to get into, coming from the Motherwell area, lots of familiar moments, places & culture. However, family toxicity was really unfamiliar to my Lanarkshire childhood life. Glad I stuck with it though, as despite some real dark post Motherwell life experiences, I enjoyed the book overall. Well written, a real shame Deborah didn't get to enjoy the accolades the book brought & she deserved.","Katrina Whittingham"
"This was a very interesting read. Orr is honest and does not shy away from the gritty bits of her life. She examines her relationship with her parents in particular, and observes how her upbringing shaped who she became. Her parents are neither idealised nor demonised, nor does she place herself as a victim or hero, but she offers an analysis of the difficulties of living with loving yet narcissistic parents.","Anne"
"A seemingly very brave, honest, possibly brutal, auto-biography of growing up in the harsh 60s-80s. A child to inflexibly minded post war parents with limited monies, council housing, limited education and aspirations, antiquated views on life, travel, and sex.
Like her I would have just wanted to scream, shout and run, yet she tried so hard to return and rekindle the relationships. Wow.
A lot of well remembered reminders of the era; good, bad, big, small, scary, sexual, political.","Martin"
"I picked this up because I liked the cover and it sounded interesting. It wasn't, particularly.
A lot of Orr's experiences growing up mirrored my own, especially once she got to university and suffered the odd rape here and there (we were fully into believing it was 'one of those things' back in the 80s), but the blurb was all about her traumatic relationship with her mother, which just didn't come across as that out of the ordinary or traumatic at all.","Francesca Pashby"
"I found this hard to get into, it seemed a bit repetitive and tangential. But once I got into the flow of it (about half way through) I found it surprisingly moving.
My other criticism was that a lot of the analysis in this seemed a bit half-baked. Orr clings onto psychological concepts like narcissism without properly unpacking them, which seems a shame as I think this book could have done more.","Mia Boddington"
"Sometimes the freshness of the wounds Orr still felt over her childhood cloud her perspective, but also it's understandable how she wrote this to say, ""Hey, I am my own person, and here's what I've learned after a life trying to please others who imposed their own narrative about me."" It is definitely also worth reading if one is looking to read about a specific time and place, '70s semi-industrial Scotland.","Sara Habein"
"I tried REALLY hard to persist with this but it's ultimately a boring mess and I've abandoned it halfway through. Orr was an inspiring woman and a brilliant writer but this isn't a good book. There are good *bits*, of wisdom and insight. There's also long bouts of 'Spangles and white dog shit' nostalgia yawns. Even when it's good it's like three or four books bolted together, perhaps because she knew she was running out of time.
I tried.","Stagger Lee"
"I’m not sure why, but it took me about 100 pages to get into this — once I did I loved it. This intelligently and beautifully written account unpicks growing up in an oppressive patriarchal community while weaving in history of Scotland and politics of eighties Britain. A heartbreakingly raw tale of self-discovery.","Rachel Hagan"
"My life is WILDLY different from this memoir - however there was SO much here that I resonated with and understood. It genuinely breaks my heart that she didn’t have the relationship she craved with her mother, and to a certain extent she was searching for that relationship her whole life. So fantastically written, loved every word of it.","Brooke Millhouse"
"A very poignant and honest memoir from a lady who always piqued my interest whenever I saw her name in the press. The book explores her difficult relationship with her family and birthplace, very much with a 'warts and all' approach. I can totally empathise (as I'm sure many will be able to) with many of the situations and how the expected 'supportive' nature of parents simply isn't as expected.","Sam Donnan"
"Really four and a half stars. Evocative of a working class childhood in Scotland in the late Sixties and Seventies. Brilliantly covers the inherent ambiguity and dichotomy of the desire to escape ones roots, when they are just that and perhaps inescapable. Especially, given a dis-functional family. You can take the girl out of Motherwell, but can you take Motherwell out of the girl?","Cooch"
"What struck me most about reading this was how utterly fucked up a lot of my childhood was.
Some sentences, quite near the end of the book that really struck me:
“It was the relationship that was defective and, it turned out, unsalvageable, not me, not her. Part of me knew it, but the most vulnerable part of me never did and maybe never will.”
3.5*","Ellen"
"Mirror image
Having grown up in a steel town, this book is entirely familiar. The psychology, the morality, the inverted snobbery and the narcissism in all its forms, and the misogyny.West of Scotland macho in all its glory. Thanks Deborah...you captured it perfectly.....even the timber houses
Bill Easton","bill easton"
"I found this an easy and atmospheric read - though I had a very different childhood from Deborah Orr's we are more or less the same age and there was much that chimed with me. But it felt like a first draft, a work in progress - a way of working out the problems of her marriage by some cod-analysis of her parents' marriage. I wish Orr had lived to give us volume 2.","Phoebe"
"A well written autobiography, although I'm not sure that I would have liked Deborah Orr, or any of her family - and her diagnosis of narcissism in almost everyone else as an explanation for their behaviour feels simplistic. But a good evocation of growing up in Motherwell, and certainly worth reading","Chris"
"Really enjoyed this. A near contemporary of mine so enjoyed all the period detail of growing up in a working class family in the 60s and 70s. The family relationships are fascinating and the discussions on individual and group narcissism made me want to know more. Made me reflect on how much more difficult it could be as a young woman in that period compared to the experience of grown up male.","John Keith"
"A fascinating story
As someone who was born and brought up not too far from Motherwell this book resonated with me. The author describes the sometimes toxic relationship with her parents and her struggle to be accepted by them A sad story no happy ending and the cancer that took both her parents life's sadly took the authors life shortly after this book was published.","Ian Ross"
"It gives a great picture of the hardships of the Thatcher Years. I could see the highrises and the gray misery. I didnt like her or her voice. It seemed like she had been to a psychiatrist and then come home and written a couple of chapters using the jargon including the concept of narcissism which did not flow in a convincing way for me.","Karen"
"Deborah Orr’s memoirs are a fantastic narration of her life growing up in Lanarkshire from the 1960s. Orr’s memoirs are full of humour, sadness, friendship and family, making Motherwell an enjoyable and inspiring read. I particularly enjoyed reading about the politics of the post-war era that has been intertwined with her history. I highly recommend this book!","Fatima P."
"I really enjoyed this, I haven’t come across anything of Deborah Orr’s before but I found her account of growing up in Motherwell so interesting. The relationships with her parents were difficult to take in to say the least. Overall it’s an honest and moving account of how our family shape us, she has such a strong voice and that made this book a real pleasure to read.","Jade Reed"
"A powerful book with an all too familiar tale of the damage a mother can do - too many resonances for me to actuallyenjoy this book and I hope I am less embittered by my hypercritical upbringing then is Deborah Orr. Like her it took me decades to gain perspective and independence and I am still seeking to overcome the inner turmoil....","Suzanne Ashworth"
"I grew up in much the same era and a similar type of community to the author, so I could relate to the descriptions provided of the era and the place. I really enjoyed the book and how the author analyses the psychology of her family, but I can understand that some readers feel that she takes some aspects of her parents behaviour and makes more of them than is justified.","Jacqueline Evans"
"A fierce and frank memorial to the incomparable Deborah Orr, made me think so much about families and our place in them and how the morals and expectations of ordinary folk have changed since WW2. As we were a similar age I felt a lot of her nostalgia for our shared childhood memories involving class, race & experience. Good social history for anyone under 30!","Gail Smith"
"The book describes working class Scottish life in the 60s & 70s. Her difficult relationship with her mother and her determination to escape the confines of her environment. I found the frequent references to narcissism a recurring theme which I found tiresome, but very much enjoyed memories I shared from that period. Another good book with plenty of themes to discuss in a book club.","Dr K N Tarrant"
"Ik snap dat Deborah Orr dit allemaal heeft opgeschreven in het kader van de traumaverwerking, maar ik vraag me af of het gepubliceerd had moeten worden. Het is zo'n persoonlijke afrekening, zo bitter. Toch was ik er wel veel mee bezig in mijn hoofd tijdens het lezen, zeker tijdens het tweede deel. Daarom toch drie sterren.","Sarah"
"This is a good provocative read. I was mother of young children at the same time as Deborah Orr's mother Win. Deborah's analysis of what happened in Motherwell in the sixties and seventies is sometimes similar but often very different from my own experience. I enjoyed her imaginative writing style and wry humour and marvelled at her memory which evoked so much of my own post war experience.","Sarah Gregory"
"It’s an interesting read and well written but also depressing. She talks about narcissism a lot and uses an inordinate amount of amount of metaphors. At times I felt she was going to explain and incident but then didn’t just wrote around it almost like the reader should know what she was referring to.","Stephanie"
"It’s an interesting life story of a great woman. It’s incredibly intimate, exposing the family dynamics so well, it’s like painting a picture.
I can’t rate it very high though as I found that most of the story started after reading half the book and the whole thing seemed, to me personally , too focused on Motherwell, even in parts where I didn’t see a point in mentioning it.","Madalina Brait"
"Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a must read. A wonderful exploration of family, growing up, poverty, narcissism, politics...and the devastating impact that Thatcher’s personal crusade to break the unions had on these towns.
Despite many Tory ministers writing to her to explain the economic value in investing in the British steel industry she, literally, sold it down the river. Motherwell, and of course many towns like it, never recovered. The Iron Lady was not a woman of steel.","Gordon Hart"
"this was not a happy book and not a lot about growing up in motherwell, i would have liked more of this. having said that this book was very readable and draws you in. it’s almost of story of a family, a story of the time, sometimes a story of the place. i did find the story jumped around a little too.","✰matthew✰"
"I really disliked this book, the first 50 pages were fine and then after that, it lost its way, it didn’t really seem to have a point to it, except to whinge about narcissism on most pages which became very boring. I finally gave up reading it as it was such a chore and I rarely ever give up on a book!","Lynn Hutchinson"
"An interesting book but too self serving in my humble opinion. It often read like a therapy session which by nature is a hugely personal experience and not of great interest to others. Sandwiched between my readings of Shuggie Bain and Maggie and me, I felt that this attempted to be more intellectual but came over as self indulgent.","Pauline"
"Heartbreaking, evocative. Deborah could really write and conjure up a childhood and a bygone era. I wanted to read more about her an found out she had died far too soon and was really shaken. I felt I had gotten to know her through this starkly honest and moving story of the struggles of being a woman.","Samantha Smith"
"A great depiction of how our childhoods shape us. I don’t know Deborah Orr’s journalism but had heard a lot of good reviews about this memoir so wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I liked the description of the bureau and how Deborah has been able to understand her upbringing. Some shocking stuff in there about women’s rights too.","Jennifer Richards"
"I just finished reading this and I am absolutely devastated to find out the author died in 2019. It was a relatable story of a woman growing up in the patriarchal 80s, with a difficult mother and too much intelligence to accept the status quo. A brilliant writer, who wrote with insight and humour about the trauma she confronted throughout her life. An enviable legacy.","Vanessa"
"Deborah recounts her childhood in Motherwell, Lanarkshire . From a working class family, she always felt quite different to them, wanting to read and go to uni rather than stay in Motherwell, get married and have babies. A lot of the events were part of my childhood too- the 3 day week, Thatcherism, the miners' strike etc, so I found it interesting to look back.","Laura Alderson"
"Having been born in the west of Scotland I immediately connected with much of the cultural context of this book. However I became increasingly disengaged with the author’s unrelenting egocentrism and tendency to blame everything negative in her life on her early beginnings which didn’t appear to me to be much different from her contemporaries at that time.","Margaret"
"Difficult to critique due to the fact the writer has passed.
This book generally felt laden with trauma.It was not at all humerous. It was sad and a bit tedious. A therapy session for her.
She had a lot of anger and confused feelings towards her parents, her mother especially..it did cross my mind this may have contributed to her diagnosis. Who knows.
Rest in peace.","Tessa"
"Poignant as this was published after her death. Orr could have been writing in a time of receiving therapy which would explain the flurry of anger towards her parents which are also described lovingly and with great respect. It's a shame she didn't live to experience a time of peace before she died.","Sarah Nicmanis"
"A good book about how one views one’s childhood in hindsight with careful analysis of classism, narcissism and capitalism and their respective impacts on the shaping of an individual. I throughly enjoyed getting lost in a wholly different world and in particular found the anecdotes from the author’s school days and early childhood days most interesting.","Gaurita"
"Terrific book, but very sad and difficult to read from an emotional point of view. Many aspects of Orr's childhild resonated with me. For anyone who grew up in the North in the 1970s this is a compelling read.","Stephanie Rampton"
"Growing up in a Scottish town
A poignant tale of a girl growing up in a small Scots town with an old fashioned david and a narcissistic mother and how the relationship with them affected her for the rest of her life.","Jenifer Lavery"
"Brutal, sad, restricted, controlling, trapped, confusing, misunderstood, revengeful, disturbing, emotional, isolated - my words to describe this memoir which overall I found intensely sad & claustrophobic","Lynda"
"I powerful and candid memoir at times cutting and painful, and certainly anxiety-inducing for the aspiring parent, but an eye-opening insight into growing up in a rapidly changing industrial town, overshadowed by parents occupying a world from several decades before.","Emily"
"Really enjoyed reading this poignant posthumous autobiographical account of growing up in Motherwell, a location which my husband knows well. In places raw, and angry, her eloquent account is fascinating. Narcissists are blamed for the many ills in society one time too many for me.","Chris Malone"
"A brilliantly written, funny and heartbreaking autobiography. Her talent and self-knowledge shine through her words. Anyone who has struggled with family members who can be emotionally damaging, whilst being unaware, might join me in a quiet sob or two by the end!","xxxxx"
"I discovered half way through reading the book that Deborah Orr has died a year ago with breast cancer. It makes my reading more poignant. I cannot imagine what it was like for her writing and finishing this book challenged by her own mortality. I read the book with immense sadness.","Cindy"
"Het lijkt alsof de schrijfster te weinig afstand heeft kunnen nemen van haar verleden en nog te zeer met haar verwerking bezig was. Wellicht overvallen door haar eigen te vroege overlijden? Het las wel makkelijk.","Coosje Van Zwol"
"I wanted to keep reading her life - good writing. Other families are always interesting and this was especially so. The articles in the bureau gave a good shape to the story. Did I mention narcissism.","Jill Schroeder"
"Having had a difficult relationship with my mum I found this book very comforting. Deborah writes in a compassionate way that made me laugh as well
as cry. The story shows the reader what being human is all about and that healing is possible although it takes time.","Georgia"
"Story of relationships. I’m not sure I would have liked the author. There were many parallels to my own life when reading this. I think it left me slightly uncomfortable reading it but I would say an interesting reflection on family and in particular mother daughter relationships.","Christine"
"A great nostalgia fest for anyone growing up in the 70s an interesting memoir by the journalist Deborah Orr of growing up in Motherwell in a family where all was rarely well with her mother. Beautifully written, it's a shame we won't get a follow up.","Steve Ayers"
"I get why some people don't take to it, and at times I struggled with it a bit, but overall it was very readable and I did enjoy it. I think it probably helps if you were brought up broadly at the same time, and if you are from a working class background from that era.","Stephen Dunstan"
"Kind of skim read this as did not hold attention a great deal as not really into the various political issues within the book but some I think would enjoy more then me, was more interested in what like growing ups at this time rather than family/political/religious issues within the area","Marc Storey"
"I too was brought up.uni working class Lanarkshire but I was born in the early 1970s. I recognise a lot of what was being said but I just admit this book was really not for me. I found it difficult to read in the end.","Steve Cassidy"
"While the links with psychology seem tenuous at times, this is an engaging memoir filled with evocative descriptions of growing up in Motherwell in the 60s and 70s, and the pain of strained relationships.","Laura"
"Absolutely engaging, often relentless.
I found this an absolutely engaging, often relentless ride through family relationships and increasing self awareness. Very thought-provoking and highly recommended.","Kenneth May"
"A bit bleak at times, I read this is small chunks. At times she seemed very angry at her parents and the world, not always without reason. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Ravenscraig and Scotland in the 70’s.","Emma Swan"
"I really struggled with this book. Started last year and couldn’t get past 30 pages, picked it up again now and got through but had a constant feeling something was about to happen that never came. Not for me.","Mark Beer"
"So many interesting points in this book, one of the few where I wanted to write to the author. Views on growing up in the 60/70s, living in the 80s. Views on mother's, narcissism and life as a woman with ambition.","Amanda Brown"
"Lovely poignant memoir of a woman coming of age whist coming to terms with her home and relationship with her mother in an era on the cusp of change. Particularly sad given Deborah’s own recent death","Clare Russell"
"I was so shocked to find out that Deborah died in 2019 as she'd had so little peace from the trauma she suffered. This was a great book, so well written even if desparately sad. Philip Larkin's poem springs to mind after reading this.","Mary"
"A bit dismal; little to distinguish it from other misery memoirs, other than being written in a relatively articulate way. Certain poignancy in that the author had died by the time the book was published. Adds nothing to the genre.","Susan Butts"
"I was really moved by this book, and saddened to think the author isn’t around anymore. It’s a brilliant evocation of growing up in the 60s and 70s in a quietly - and not so quietly - dysfunctional family. Sad and funny and gripping.","Jackie Kingsley"

"The author is angry with her parents, and the emotional abuse she endured will surely ring bells with many readers growing up in the 60s or 70s whose parents were shaped by the same social mores and political circumstances. Reading the book made me reflect on my own feelings towards my parents, and think about what my children might think about me. We're all of us affected by our socio political environment - and that has changed so much since the 1960s / 70s. A psychoanalyst tells the author it's the little things that you have to watch out for - these things leave their mark. Definitely food for thought, but I'm genuinely in two minds about how useful too much examination is. Is this itself narcissistic? (A criticism the author levels at her own parents and ex husband too). An interesting read; quite sad and a bit depressing.","Emma Tiller"

"Reading this made me grateful to be an immigrant in a foreign land and therefore always an outsider, here and in HK. Fitting in is so overrated. I thought her life was completely horrendous. My parents’s lives, education and generation were entirely different to hers but they took it in their stride I would go to University and get a job. Maybe it was me but they probably knew criticism would just wash over me. If they disapproved, I never cared. And men! I’ve never been more grateful for John after reading this. Is it wrong to be eternally grateful I need never read this again?","Yeemay"
"Deborah Orr was a name I vaguely knew from her articles and her marriage to Will Self but I read the book because her Scotland was partially my Scotland. I came from the other side of Glasgow but had friends who worked in British Steel and Ravenscraig punctuated Glasgow as did the shipyards The industrial side and Orr writes about her childhood in Motherwell and her Glasgow but then she moved to St Andrews my St Andrews where she goes to the University and hates it.
Her parents are strict and difficult and she longs for their approval and love.
Her experiences of Scotland are different from mine My family was confident and loving but I recognise the angst,so many of my friends experienced it and no woman who grew up in the 70s and 8os could fail to be moved by her story.
I was so sad to find she died last year she had quite the story to tell","Fiona"
"I I thought I would enjoy this book but I found the constant criticism of her parents and the psychological terms she described them in very hard going. We get it you didn’t get on with them.","Frances maguire"
"What a book full of misery. Thought my family was dysfunctional till I read this. An upbringing purporting to be happy, bordering on child abuse.
Growing up in the same era as myself, I recognise and relate to the social history but the fallout for this woman is crushing..","Sue"
"While I enjoyed this memoir on the whole I struggled to keep up the pace in the second half of the book. I was getting weary with the self-indulgence (perhaps this is the point of a memoir). It felt as if Deborah had been ‘over counselled’. She used the word narcissist way too frequently. I did enjoy the parts that described (rather harshly at times) life in Motherwell in the 70’s but I felt overall the book was a tad too long and overly wordy. Would I recommend? Yes but with a caveat - well written childhood memoir punctuated with excessive and rather irritating cod psychology ramblings.","Kazamate"
"The maws a bit shan. Aye, guid.","Caroline Gibson"
"A good book and for me apart from Debra Orr’s personal struggle, shows clearly that any person that believes a Tory government understands or cares about the majority of working people is seriously in denial. It was a brave book for Debra Orr to write considering her tragic illness.","Keith Lucas"
"Loved this, we similar age so triggered lots of memories for me whilst reading even though I wasn't brought up in Scotland. Not my normal reading genre but made a nice change.","Sandra"
"mummy issues but make it difficult to read","Carys Morris"
"I have to say this book has been hard to get into. But after about half of it, I felt I could relate so deeply to the author and her experience that, in the end, the book left a mark on me. Luckily, I have had an easier life so far than Deborah Orr has had - whilst also being captured by the beauty of many of her childhood experiences- and I have grown up in a different time (with much more progressive parents). Still, as a daughter, this book still helped me to understand more about my childhood, my relationship to my parents and my childhood home. Also, though I feel the author would have disagreed, the book showed me the importance small souvenirs of our lives past can help us in revisiting and remembering. It will not be a book for everyone, but I am really thankful to the author for the climpse into her past she shared with me.","Outdoor Economist"
"This is a truly honest memoir of Deborah Orr's life growing up in Motherwell, Scotland, in a housing estate. She describes living in a working class community but her focus is mainly on her family dynamics and in particular, her relationship with her mother which was multifaceted and complicated.
There are many elements within this book that many of us will associate with in our own growing up years and some long forgotten memories may surface on reading this novel. I recommend this no holds barred account of one woman's life.","Anne"
"I started reading this not long after the author had died. She was a wonderful writer and I enjoyed her work in The Guardian before alot. You don't get writers like that in the Guardian these days. This book is fantastic as well and I sobbed at the end.","MistyM"

"A raw memoir from the late Deborah Orr, I thought ""Motherwell"" was eloquently and poignantly written, depicting difficult family dynamics and the way they affected her life well into adulthood.
I gave it a 7/10 and the full review can be found here: https://www.2percentbooks.com/motherw...","Grace"
"I didn't get on with this as well as I thought I should. I did enjoy her descriptions of Motherwell and surroundings, industrial Ravenscraig... I read the book because, despite knowing little about DO, people who I rated talked of her lust for life (when she was alive) and her razor-sharp wit. She also had been married to Will Self and that was the thing that propelled me to her, ""what character could ever be married to Will Self?!"" Her autobiography meandered through Motherwell and her parents took centre stage. But her story did not move me, it sounded like a familiar refrain amongst many children of parents of that generation :staying in unhappy marriages, not living out their potential, making do, keeping up with the neighbours. A familiar continuing refrain. I didn't dislike it but neither did I marvel at her writing.","Susannah"
"I nearly gave up on this once and then it unfolded to be brilliant. I hope Orr is somewhere with her mum, having the relationship she wanted.","K"
"Heartbreaking, lovely, as train-of-thought as memoirs often are. Such a fascinating insight into how parents are often a bundle of contradictions - one page Orr was describing how terrible her mother was, the next how much she loved and admired her. I would have loved to have read more about Orr’s later life, which felt quite squashed into the final few chapters - but it didn’t spoil what was a really beautiful - if also sad, angry and spiteful at points - book.","R H"
"Beautifully written. But we know Deborah Orr has a way with words. Feelings of anger but also great sadness.","Maria"
"Incredible, I have never read anything quite like Motherwell.","liza"
"Family
A personal view of working class family life in an industrial town which was then torn apart by the Ravenscraig closure and consequent unemployment.

"compelling and bleak account of a scottish childhood with serious mother issues against the backdrop of 60s and 70s britain. I was sad to read that her hard won escape to university did not bring happiness.","Jane Curry"

"Social history
I found this book annoying, intriguing, part social history,part family dynamics, part memoir.
It was an interesting read but I don't think I would recommend it","rosemary wood"
"Such a very personal and exposing memoir. Scotland, narcissism, family, relationships, class and university. Lots in it to relate to.","Mrs"
"An excellent memoir - honest, thoughtful and self-aware. Some startling sections on her parents’ response to her emerging sexuality and (separately) the shocking sexual violence she suffered.","Thomas"
"I don't know why I thought that this memoir would cover more of the adult life as well and moving to London - because the title states quite explicity what it covers. This is both a personal story as well as the story of a generation and a place.","Marina Sofia"
"BBC Book of the week. Heard one episode and thought I would give it a go.
As she said it was like growing up in a religious cult without the religion. A tough read","Jamad"
"This was a strange book to read. I'm aware it was finished under difficult circumstances but, in my view, much of the half baked theorising about narcissism should have been ruthlessly edited out. I also think it was a bad call to make so much of the book a complaint about her mother even if it did mean Orr could make the connection with name of the town she grew up in - her mother did not ""Mother well"". Reading the book however I was left with the strong impression that both her parents, especially her mother, loved her very much and did the best they could. The sum of her mother's failings seem to add up to some hurtful remarks and insecurity over the years but I think a fair daughter would have weighed this against all the love and care and trips to the library and support to do well at school etc and not have felt the need for this public excoriation. Win was not without fault but I ended up feeling very sorry for her. I don't think she deserved this posthumous treatment. I wonder if Orr had had a chance to revise the book a few more times, if a more polished gem would have emerged- there's no doubt she had a way with words and a story to tell about herself and her girlhood and Motherwell and class and feminism amongst other things. As it was it felt like she was focused on reliving trauma and blaming her mother for everything.I read Ben Watt's memoir about his parents ""Romany and Tom"" recently and I think that was a better and fairer portrait of a parental relationship which did not ignore problematic aspects but which placed these properly in context.","Amanda"
"A really bleak story. I suppose it resonated a bit with me because she’s just a little bit younger than me and at university I had a boyfriend from Wishaw, not that I had the family experience that she did. Overwhelming in parts particularly the university years and beyond. Well worth reading though.","Frances Bestley"

"Raw, emotional, powerful and uncompromising laced with a hint of humour.","Wendy Temple"
"Exceptionally perceptive as autobiographies go. This is a great deal less culpatory than I thought it would be, but there is a tightly controlled subsurface fury that makes the whole book hum. It’s irresistible.","John Feetenby"
"I read this essentially in one sitting, after wanting to read it for a while. What I will say is I wish I'd read more of Deborah Orr's journalism while she was alive. In many ways her life echoes my own and I felt at points I was reading my own autobiography. There are some difficult parts to read in this.
Deborah's life as someone who is intelligent and possesses critical thinking skills from a young age is out of step with the working class community she grew up in. She doesn't fit in. Her parents had extremely traditional views that clashed with Deborah's own surrounding pre marital sex and what a woman's place is.
Deborah was brought up in Scotland's oppressive 60s and 70s while the country's social conventions were still gripped by presbyterianism, things haven't really changed for young women growing up in post industrial towns in working class Scotland - especially if their parents were brought up in such an oppressive environment.
Great books are ones in which you learn something about yourself from reading. I've certainly had a lot of food for thought from this.","Lauren Gilmour"
"A phenomenal read by the late and truly great journalist Deborah Orr, who herself questioned whether the book was memoir therapy or vengeance.
Orr was raised in working class Lanarkshire, Scotland, in a time and place when girls were expected to be seen and not heard. They certainly weren't expected to go off to university and become award winning journalists or 'career girls' as her mother would dismissively label her. She delves deep into her childhood and uncovers a passive narcissism which can run through families and entire towns, that can shape personalities and blur boundaries.
Having grown up in the seventies, there were several times I had to put this book down, take some deep breaths and reflect on the era I grew up in, and the expectations and judgements surrounding us.
I can honestly say that I finished this book feeling like I'd had therapy myself! I only wish Deborah was around to thank. A must read for women born in the sixties and seventies.","Betsy Price"
"Soms vraag ik me af of recencenten de boeken die ze bespreken ook wel werkelijk gelezen hebben.
Vooral in de Britse pers werd dit boek lovend onthaald, volgens mij ten onrechte.
Ik vond het eerder overroepen en kon me nog het beste vinden in de bespreking ervan die verscheen in de Nederlandse krant Het Parool.
Was het wel allemaal zo erg?
De auteur beschrijft nogal veel niet ter zake doende details, die soms op zich wel interessant zijn, zoals de sociale huisvesting in Groot Brittannië. Maar ze gaat daarin te ver. Ook kwam hetgeen ze schreef op mij vaak onsamenhangend over. Ze alludeert vaak op wat nog moet komen qua negatieve eigenschappen van haar moeder, waar ze het blijkbaar erg moeilijk mee had. Maar zo vreselijk vond ik die vrouw achteraf niet.
Wat Deborah Orr blijkbaar wil vertellen over haar ouders, hoe erg zij wel werd behandeld, komt helemaal niet uit de verf, net door het te veel bewandelen van zijwegen.
Jammer.","Lili Bammens"
"This is a touching and poignant memoir of Deborah’s Orr upbringing and the role her family played in shaping her whether these be positive or negative memories. The book’s sociological depictions are completely accurate of a post war period of renewal and rejuvenation of this area of Glasgow but there is also great courage in its manner of uncovering family secrets. (There can be few better accounts of how the postwar working-class strove so complicatedly for “betterness”.) (O’Hagan 2020 in the Guardian)
Deborah escaped to London where she was to marry the journalist and novelist Will Self and I enjoyed her depiction of life with Will Self, she is disconcertingly honest and self-revealing about many parts of her life throughout this book. So much so that parts of it stay with you long after you have put the book back from wherever it came.","Moira McLoughlin"
"I didn't enjoy this at all. It felt to me that she was unfair to her mother, as her father was equally to blame for much of what went on at home. She just liked her father more.
I also felt that blaming her mother entirely for her PTSD was unfair when she'd endured some other horrific experiences (a gang rape and a further rape / violent assault, several terminations of pregnancy), as well as long term bullying at school, all of which must surely have contributed.
And the stuff about narcissism was repetitive and inaccurate. At one point she even admits no psychiatrist would consider her mother a narcissist. Well, in that case surely she wasn't one!","Judith Rich"
"Bit of an impulse purchase, Hadn't heard anything about this book before buying it.
Slow to start, kept waiting for something dramatic to happen and it doesn't. It has received high praise but left me underwhelmed and a bit bored.
She makes a lot of complaints about her mother not supporting her wanting more of a life for herself than just to leave school, get married and have children and although I can understand how that must have been difficult I did read it thinking 'And?' and 'So What?'","Ann"
"I don’t think I’d heard of Deborah Orr until just before she died, but felt compelled to read her book, interested in her upbringing in a Scottish town. “Motherwell” is beautifully complex and thoughtful - an intriguing examination of the nuances and effects of childhood and parental relationships.","Calum Falconer"
"Repetitive psychoanalysis of her family who are apparently all narcissists… as she mentions every other page. Some interesting childhood anecdotes and a nice portrait of her home town but the structure was messy, the writing was poor, and I struggled to have much sympathy for the author as she (it seemed to me) whinged and whinged and whinged.","Poppy Hicks"
"I really miss Deborah’s writing and loved her brutally honest memoir. Although younger and male, my parents were of the same generation as hers and I recognise so many of the situations she writes about. I","Christopher"
"As a contemporary of the author and having grown up in a working class town ""up North"" I'd expected a gentle nostalgia trip. Yes, some memories revived for me but this is a brutally honest memoir which I'll reflect on for quite a while to come. Compelling.","Steve"
"(unsure how to write this considering the multitude of v sad circumstances but I found it q hard to engage with until about pg 200)","KW"
"Absolutely loved this book. Reminders of my own childhood. The bureau that held all the mysterious important docs We had one in fact still do!!","Deb"
"With so many cultural references familiar to me and describing not only her life but the era this was a hit.","Clare"
"Brilliant, wonderfully written and captures 1970s/80s Scotland exceptionally well.","Gillian Norrie"
"A generally good read which recounts the life of Deborah Orr growing up in Motherwell. Despite appearing at time to be a random stream of consciousness rather a linear narrative I would recommend.","Lauren"
