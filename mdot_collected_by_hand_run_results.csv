I read this book in French (because I'm french!). But I comment it in English, beacause I'd like you, English readers who would like to discover French state of mind from the late 18th and early 19th century and also the great History he really lived. It's not really fun, but it's Chateaubriand! So it's clever, pretentious (he could be!), historically very interesting and so many things more!,Gabrielle Dubois
The first half was INCREDIBLE. Second half was really good too, focuses on Napoleon a lot, almost a mini biography of Napoleon Bonaparte. Francois Chateaubriand was a cool guy. I like him. We would have been friends. We have a similar haircut.,Bud Smith
Typical the work of a man with a large 'ego', looking for justification; more than any other this book has strong Romantic traits. Chateaubriand is a liberal in his principles (freedom is central), but clearly conservative in politics (his option for monarchism); perhaps that explains his marginal relevance as a historical person. But this certainly is a remarkable historical document, presenting an enchanting introspection into a turbulent mind. The most interesting pages treat about Napoleon, the passages on his own public actions are less captivating. And oh, I almost forgot: what a succinct, eloquent French he wrote!,Marc
I want to be Chateaubriand, or nothing - Victor Hugo,Bettie
As I write these last words, on 16 November 1841, my window, which looks west over the gardens of the Foreign Missions, is open: it is six o'clock in the morning: I can see the pale and swollen moon; it is sinking over the spire of the Invalides scarcely touched by the first golden ray from the east: one might imagine that the old world was ending and the new beginning. I behold the light of a dawn whose sunrise I shall never see. It only remains for me to sit down at the edge of my grave: then I shall descend boldly, crucifix in hand, into eternity. This is an excellent memoir, but it is also much more than a mere retelling of one man’s life. François-René de Chateaubriand is witness to a world in the midst of change. He observes as France goes from an old monarchy to constitutional, after the Republic follows Napoleon and finally a return to monarchy again. Melancholic musings on his childhood and youth convey the slow but sure decay of old rites and customs—ultimately finding its climax in the violence of the French Revolution. Tragedy is on every page, as his family members and acquaintances are sent to the guillotine, or when his sister and childhood companion dies. There is a sombre beauty in the manner in which he dualizes some events of the past, showing them as they appeared to him at the time but equipped with future knowledge. The smile of Marie-Antoinette is paired with the memory of him identifying her jaw-bone in a mass grave. The memoir stands as a witness to history and a witness to a dying world and it catches a glimpse of what new order is to come. It is also a portrait of personal tragedy, of the melancholy of one man and his attempts to grasp life at its core. The writing is hauntingly beautiful at times, with Romantic renderings of nature and a tender understanding of the human soul.,Nadia 
simply loved this. One of those books that you internalise and stays with you. His childhood! His forbidding father pacing the room from the fire to the end plunged in darkness, in silence! Those encounters with Napoleon. That occasion when the Napoleonic army crosses the river into Russia and he hears music, like in Antony and Cleopatra, the god of war whom he loved now leaving him. Heaven.,Fazackerly Toast
Whoops, turns out I don’t know French. But someday I might. I’m keeping this little book around for that day.[own but have not read],Mia
An absorbing memoir of a man who led a most intriguing life. Moving from his early childhood through the various phases of his life, this autobiography reveals many of his personal characteristics and aspirations during a very interesting period of French history.,Bill
Such a great book!!,Maan Kawas
A very smart man with a sharp quill. Probably one of my first literary love. I fancied the man who'd written such things, lived such a life. Damn he's got some ego, but mostly well deserved. His memoirs are an amazing glimpse in the life and politics of some of the richest and most turbulent decades of french history,Elenora
I felt like I belonged in the Tombe after reading this ponderous book.,Marianne
Literally Memoirs from Beyond the Grave is an autobiography in 42 volumes. The version I read had volumes 9-12, covering life and travels from April to September 1822, revised in December 1846.,D
over rated. poor little rich kid grows up , flees france to save his head from the revolution. very self absorbed ponce.,Stosch
The more I read books like this, the more I find that I enjoy them. The Education of Henry Adams, Confessions of an Italian (Ippolito Nievo), Remembrance of Things Past (Marcel Proust) and Memoirs from Beyond the Tomb to me are of the same family. Also his view of Napoleon and the misery he caused which is decidedly not the same as the monuments and street names all over Paris commemorating Napoleon.,John
The man certainly knows how to tell a story - the premise being living through the birth of America, the French Revolution, Napoleon's rise and fall, and finally the last gasps of the monarchy in France. His presents himself as one weathering countless ideology & political storms, staying true to his own beliefs. It's a little funny to hear him talk so much about a love of liberty contra Napoleon just after he denounced the Terror (which spilt the blood of his family in the name of liberty). As a thinker he's not so interesting - just a standard reactionary who believes it is good to be well off and religious (and those less well off should grit their teeth and bear it).,Paul
I was expecting to find this book interesting as a historical source, but was surprised to love it as literature. Even in translation two centuries later, Chateaubriand has a felicity with language that oozes through the page — belying his early disclaimer that he is not one for wit. These memoirs are full of well-turned phrases and surprisingly self-aware observations from Chateaubriand's full life, which included a childhood growing up in a castle with a distant father, an irresolute young adulthood that included a sojourn exploring America (a sort of 18th Century gap year), fame as a best-selling author and a denouement as a statesman and diplomat. Even the less exciting bits, such as Chateaubriand's childhood, are highly readable, while his character study of Napoleon is incisive (if not wholly reliable). My only complaints have to do with the apparent abridgment of this Penguin translation (not advertised at all on the physical copy). There are obvious gaps in the narrative — his pilgrimage to the Holy Land is constantly referenced but never actually described; the treatment of his diplomatic service under the Restoration is frustratingly vague; even his coverage of Napoleon, the meaty center of the book, covers only three major incidents from Bonaparte's reign in depth. I'm sure the original version would seem interminably long today, so some abridgment was surely necessary, but it's best to go in with an understanding of the Penguin edition as a snapshot of a larger work. It's a testament to Chateaubriand's sparkling prose that I wanted more, David Montgomery
Like a great dinner conversation via a time machine. Chateaubriand's life straddled a very changing world, in his native France as well as the New World. I especially enjoyed his descriptions of growing up in St. Malo, having recently visited there myself (due to my love of All the Light We Cannot See). His passages describing America just after the Revolutionary War, in particular his accounts of visiting with Native Americans, were also very entertaining and unique. A great read for history lovers and an obviously important book in the development of French literature.,John Williams
Extremely overrated: memoirs of an old guy who repaints himself larger than life and nicely removes anything conspicious. Maybe it says something about the french soul if this is termed a masterpiece?,Geert
Apocryphally, when Zou Enlai was asked in 1973 about the effects of the French Revolution, he replied: Too early to say. I wanted to read an account of the French Revolution and its aftermath. Chateaubriand, the French writer and romantic, lived through the times and left a compendious memoir, and presumably is an interesting source. Unfortunately, his whole memoirs run into 1000+ pages and seem hard to find in an English translation. I had to get this Penguin edition of 'selections', as it is the only reasonable priced commonly available edition of his work in print. There seems to be a more recent NYRB-Classics edition of the complete work, but it is expensive and hard to find. This book is about 450-page selection from his whole text, and thankfully it appears whole chapters have been taken from the full text without any reduction, only many of the chapters have been left out. I think the chapters concerning with events in France pertaining to the Revolution, and time of Napolean has been included. The ones not included are majorly the ones about his travels abroad in the Levant and other places. Chateaubriand though misses out witnessing most of the events of the revolution directly since he is out of France for a large portion of the time. Almost at the breaking out of the revolution, he sets out on a futile adventure in search of the North-West Passage in North America. In America, he is not really impressed by the young republic. There he meets George Washington briefly, later that interview would provide him material to compare Napolean with Washington, unfavourably to the former. The tumult of the revolution soon starts to affect his own family who were feudal lords of some standing. He returns to Europe, called by the tragic fate which befell some of his near family. Later he joins the army in exile fighting to overthrow the revolution. Soon though he is injured and escapes to England, where he makes a beginning in his literary career. The most dramatic and shocking episodes of the Reign of Terror, the period of extreme violence and fanaticism, he views from a distance. His own sister and mother end up in prison. However, once the Napolean seizes power, there is a brief respite in the tumult, and Chateaubriand returns to France. From now on, Napolean seems his central focus. Though there was a period in which Napolean and Chateaubriand seemed polite acquaintances with a degree of respect between them, as Napolean by turns, became more illiberal, and more on the path to despotism, the gulf between them widens, till it reached a point where they are almost enemies. Chateaubriand's writing is more impactful when he is narrating the time of Napolean. He has seen the man at close, and understood his genius as well as the flaws in his character. The staggering military feats of the Napolean from Italy, Austria, and on the path to Russia is astounding. That a single man could muster enough force of personality to bring down the edifices of long-established European monarchies, over such vast geographies and peoples seems something beyond human. But soon enough he is faced with adversity. The campaign in Russia turns out to be a tragedy for the Grand Armee in their long retreat. A few of the most elaborate chapters are of the Napoleans two banishments. First to Elba an island off the Italian coast. Then one of the most romantic passages in history unfolds: his100 Days, when Napolean made a daring escape from Elba, lands on the French coast, and marches on to Paris to reclaim the mantle. This again calls the opposing European powers back to war with France, culminating in the final battle of Waterloo where Napolean, by the turn of events stood defeated. He is then sent on his final and permanent exile on the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic. Chateaubriand has a moving, and reflective chapter on Napoleon's life and eventual death in St Helena. Chateaubriand writes: I have explored the seas of the Old World and the New, and trodden the soil of the four quarters of the globe. After sleeping in the cabins of the Iroquois and the tents of Arabs, in the wigwams of Hurons and the remains of Athens, Jerusalem, Memphis, Carthage, and Granada, in the homes of Greeks, Turks and Moors and among forests and ruins; after wearing the bearskin cloak of the savage and the silk caftan of the Mameluke, and after enduring poverty, hunger, thirst, and exile, I have taken my place, as a minister and ambassador, trimmed with gold lace and plastered with ribbons and decorations, at the table of kings, at the festivities of princes and princesses, only to fall more into indigence and to taste prison life. He surely lived in interesting times. Though there were much privation and human suffering around him, the passage of human history which he witnessed, saw fundamental changes in political systems and peoples lives, whose farthest repercussions were are still feeling to this day, and I thought his memoirs gave a thoughtfully written, individual perspective of it,Ajoy
It is seldom that a major historical figure is also a great writer. Chateaubriand was both and not only he describes the turbulent events of the French Revolution and the following era, but was one shaping many of those events. Let us not forget, however, that first of all Chateaubriand was great romantic writer and the Memories is much more than a history book or an autobiography. Especially beautiful are the chapters describing his childhood and youth and his travels to America. We see here the seeds of his famous works like René and Atala; both heavily influenced not only by the travels, but revealing many elements of his own life, especially the complicated relationship with his sister. While in his novels the fiction and reality are mixed, in his Memories it is only the reality, painted however with the brush of a great romantic writer. A fascinating reading for the lover of both history and of literature and an important original source.,Morzejko Leporello
Mémoires d’outre-tombe (1849–50), his memoir from “beyond the tomb,” written for posthumous publication and perhaps his most lasting monument. This memoir, which Chateaubriand began writing as early as 1810, is as much a history of his thoughts and sensations as it is a conventional narrative of his life from childhood into old age. The vivid picture it draws of contemporary French history, of the spirit of the Romantic epoch, and of Chateaubriand’s own travels is complemented by many self-revealing passages in which the author recounts his unstinting appreciation of women, his sensitivity to nature, and his lifelong tendency toward melancholy. Chateaubriand’s memoirs have proved to be his most enduring work,Marcos Augusto
Here is the account by a man who lived through some of the most turbulent , yet fascinating times in France's history. He met George Washington, Louis the XVI, MME. de Stael, Napoleon, Louis XVIII....etc. I'm giving it 5 stars for the writing and a style which clearly influenced Marcel Proust. I don't think I'm really qualified to judge the work further because I'm not a historian of the period. Also, it is not exactly a complete autobiography in the normal sense. But he was there and he lived it.,Robert Muir
Unfortunately I really struggled to get through this. I enjoyed the account of the first part of his life but got really bogged down when Napoleon enters the scene. Chateaubriand writes in a curiously oblique and contradictory style, and it’s difficult to know how he feels about any of the events he describes. In fact he tells you very little about what he actually did - I learned more from just looking at Wikipedia. Overall I found this tedious and a disappointment.,Toby
He spends his time lying, but he writes well.,Jacques
Perfect snapshot of the period,Stéphane
I have read books that offered much more illuminating perspectives on Napoleon Bonaparte; perhaps this was deemed beyond the pale for its time?,Andrew Noselli
Born to an old aristocratic (but not very wealthy) Breton family, Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand was born less than a year before Napoleon Bonaparte. Like Bonaparte, Chateaubriand was a young man in his early 20s when the French Revolution broke out. Like his family, Chateaubriand was a Royalist, and was presented to Louis XVI at Versailles during the last days of the Anicen Regime. While the Revolution would take a terrible toll on his family, Chateaubriand recognized that many of the changes it brought about were salutary, and that there was no turning back the clock. Admired by Napoleon for his work The Genius of Christianity, Chateaubriand--who returned to the Church after his mother'd death--was given a diplomatic post, which he resigned when Napoleon had Louis XVI's cousin, the duc d'Enghien, murdered. While he admired much that Bonaparte accomplished (putting an end to the Revolution, the Code Napoleon, etc.), and acknowledged his military genius, ultimately Chateaubriand faulted Napoleon for being above all an adventurer, one who trod France underfoot and led scores of thousands of her sons to their deaths, most notably in the disastrous Russian campaign. Loyal to the restored Bourbon monarchs Louis XVIII (1814-24) and Charles X (1824-30), Chateaubriand was nonetheless mortified at (1) their employing disreputable old Republicans like Talleyrand and Fouche, (2) the efforts of Charles X to undermine the Restoration Charter (or constitution), rightly predicting that it would end in the monarchy being swept away, as it was in the July Revolution. Indeed, Chateaubriand would live long enough to see the resulting July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe toppled in 1848. Add to this incredible sweep of French history the fact that Chateaubriand sojourned in America in the early 1790s, even meeting President George Washington in Philadelphia. A wonderful read.,Mshelton50
This memoir feels less like any other and more like a narrative of a character from ‘ Peace and War’ novel by L Tolstoy. It recounts the life story of Francis Chateaubriand during the French Revolution and Napoleon’s reign in France. From his aristocratic childhood in Saint Malo, to his explorer adventures in US and Canada, his return as a soldier to the camps of Germany, his exile to England, opposition to Bonaparte and finally embassador life. Beautifully written, thought provoking, and interesting life story of a complex individual.I highly recommended the book.My favorite quotes from the book;“True happiness is not expensive; if it costs dear, then it is of an inferior nature”“ A man arriving like myself in the United States, full of enthusiasm for the people of classical antiquity, a colonist looking everywhere for the rigidity of early Roman life was bound to be shocked by the luxuriousness of the carriages, the frivolity of the conversations, the inequality of fortunes, the immorality of the banks and gaming houses, the noisiness of the ballrooms and theaters” “If the world were an explosive globe, I would not hesitate to set to fire, if it were a question of setting my country free”,Mahdi H
If you are interested in a journey into eighteenth century France, into the darkest episodes of the French Revolution, the Empire and then the restoration. If you want to feel a small breeze stroking your brow in Palestine, meet Washington and Franklin, visit the American wilderness or the neat gardens of London, this books is for you. The second half of the book is more like a series of chronicles about the Napoleonic years but much of this book is among the best books ever written. A true gem of French Romanticism.,Sim Written
Hmmm. I'm glad I learned about Chateaubriand, even if he was the hardest of hardcore reactionaries. But I was surprised by how much of his book was taken up with stuff he didn't witness -- like Napoleon's Russian campaign.,Blake Spraggins
the most beautiful book [want to read],Chris
Studied at univeristy. I think we didn't study the whole book, but rather specific parts of it. I don't really remember. I do know that I found Chateaubriand's story interesting.,Rea 
I read an English translation of this, of course... An excellent read, beautiful style, incredible life.,Daniel
I'm not much for reading... but after having gone through about 10 other classics since reading this book I'd give this one 6 stars if I could.,Ray Harajuku
