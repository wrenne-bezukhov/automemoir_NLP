"An attempt to capture the fleeting moments of a life and the intersection between the public and the private. Even when it doesn't work, it's still an interesting effort.","Jennifer Snyder"
"My level of French simply is not sufficient to understand the complexities of this book, but I got enough out of it to want to read it and fully understand it in English. Unfortunately I haven't found a translated version of it yet.","Egypt Rai"
"This was complex and really well done. Ernaux is a very good writer and you can really tell. The idea of using images to tell the story of one woman and the larger story of French history was really interesting.","Gabrielle S"
"My second 'heavy' French literature book (in French), this one was a tough start. The author is very descriptive and through the first pages it takes a while for things to pick up. 'Les Années' is Annie's autobiography, but not just that - and this is my positive takeaway from this book: it's also a summary of world history over the 20th century through her eyes, going from mankind happenings to society's fears and diseases. Her story is very blend, but she makes it interesting by writing on a 'confessional style', and not being afraid to show that her life is not always a fairy tale. One never knows her stand and her own view as herself (she stands mostly as the author as a third-person) up until the end of the book, which is partly boring (as the reading becomes too generic) but also surprising, when she reveals her true self over the last pages and things become much more personal. I give it 3/5 for my mixed impressions - partly blaming myself for my French reading skills - with an overall 'recommendation' note.","Rafael"
"A book about nostalgia...but the nostalgia of a time that the reader hasn't lived in. Boring at first...but impressive by the end.  Updated on 4/16/2018  My review originally published on LA Review of Books:  https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/t...   THE YEARS BY Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa.  Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.  Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person. In French, “on” is a generic/collective “he/she,” which could be translated to “one” in English. But it is very difficult to maintain a whole book, narrated in “one” point of view, so, in the translation, instead of this generic third person, “we” has been used. Unlike the classic form of the genre, which can be defined as solely focusing on the author’s personal life events, The Years is a new form of writing a memoir where the sense of urgency is intertwined with muted emotions. As much as a writer such as Karl Ove Knausgaard lets his imagination take off in reimagining and rebuilding his past life with fiction and memories indistinguishable from one another, Ernaux does the opposite. Unlike her previous work, all autofiction, in The Years she doesn’t intend to reexamine and fictionalize her life. Her main focus is to stay away from fiction, truthful to her own exact memories from the world she has lived in, throughout the years. She writes in a voice that can be described, most of the time, as journalistic (not sensational journalism, but informative journalism), but there is an undertone of melancholy without ever being overly melancholic or poetic. Ernaux keeps the images two dimensional, therefore love, despair, hatred, or hope are absent from the surface of the page.  All the images will disappear […] Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.  The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished.  There is a parallel between reading The Years and a whirling dervish who is turning incessantly, slowly transcending into a state of “high” beyond the present moment. The reader might be tempted to turn her head away, yet at the same time wonder how much longer the dervish would continue his rise to the out-of-this-world state.  The future is replaced by a sense of urgency that torments her. She [Ernaux] is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent, as it was her first years of life, which she won’t remember anymore.  Approaching an age where death becomes a near possibility, she writes to remember a past that seems to be slipping away. With time and distance, Ernaux becomes an observer of the events of her own life. And by doing so, the reader — instead of becoming a witness to one’s life and feeling empathy and emotions for someone else (the writer) — slowly becomes part of the narration, and creates a new kind of inward sentimentality. Almost as if it is the writer who is the witness to her reader’s memories. This phenomenon could be compared to intertextuality.  Reading The Years makes the reader ponder the meaning of literature. Is Ernaux’s work “literature” per se, or a study in sociology? When a memoir lacks the author’s emotions, and when it is written, on purpose, with no intention of moving its reader, how can we still call it a work of art? What is Art?  Ernaux has revealed in interviews that she has been taking notes for decades to prepare for writing this book, which, for the right reason, is called her magnum opus. At first glance and through the first pages, the book’s unfamiliar form tests the reader’s patience. After reading two dozen snippets, the reader might wonder how much longer she can go on. There are many cultural, political, and historical references, unfamiliar to the reader who has no background or interest in the French/francophone world. The Years is not an easy read, having no plot, climax, moral lesson, or humor. These are the intimate details of a French life that might go over the heads of many. It is not a fast read either.  It is the kind of book you close after reading a few pages, carried away by the bittersweet taste it leaves in your mind. If you persist, opening yourself to the rhythm and brief impressions, the narration impacts your mind, and you discover a meaning behind the facade. The real magic happens outside of the book, or indirectly beneath the flow of reading each individual snippet. At some point, the reader is moved by an anecdote of her own life, as she recognizes herself in a singular memory of the collective voice of the narration. Parallel to the linear act of reading, the reader transcends into a vertical movement toward personal experiences and vague reminiscences. This makes the memoir “un-personal,” and by eliminating herself from the memory, Ernaux transforms her life into history and her memories into the collective memory of a generation.  We read about the effect of the war on the youth in France, World War II and La guerre d’Algérie, the girl in the black-and-white photo and her place in the world, feminism, sexuality, the digital revolution, and color TV, most popular books and pop songs, the way girls dressed up and dreamed, existentialism, Ernaux’s marriage and maternity, September 11, her father’s death, her cancer, her career, love, the evolution of morality, communists, Arabs in France and immigration, banlieu de Paris, et cetera.  Between what happens in the world and what happens to her, there is no point of convergence. They are two parallel series: one abstract, all information no sooner received than forgotten, the other all static shots.  Is it possible to grasp the true sense of a life lived, through a backward glance at static shots that remain in one’s memory? Kafka says, “We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.” Ernaux doesn’t write to not be forgotten. She doesn’t write for some continuation after her death. For her, images disappear, so she has no other option than to write to capture those moments on the verge of disappearing. She writes to bring to life those static shots, trapped in the passage of time, for the future generations. The little girl in the black-and-white photo can be any other little girl. And the picture of her late sister at six represents all dead children of those years, because “[t]here were dead children in every family.” This is how the particular becomes universal and one’s tragedy transforms into human tragedy.  Since her first memoir, The Place (1983), Ernaux has been writing the story of her life, and with each book, she has gone deeper and deeper to the core of these events. In the process, she has revolutionized the art of memoir by removing the sentimentality out of her voice. Annie Ernaux, largely translated in Europe, is less known in the United States, maybe because the American publishing industry is less interested in little, intimate memoirs. The French language by nature is lyrical and full of music. Translating Ernaux, with her particular “unpoetic” voice, doesn’t seem to be an easy task. But Alison L. Strayer, faithful to Ernaux’s intention, has kept the book’s authentic color and rhythm, the un-poetry of the text, but also its poetic undertone.  Even if you haven’t lived in the same decades, even if you have never set foot in France, you still might be moved, bouleversé by an unexplainable melancholy. Your own memories are mixed with images of a world you don’t know, and yet it seems so familiar: a world that is banal, yet still legendary. Insignificant and still mythological. It is a meta-nostalgia if we use scientific definition. Like a model of nostalgia that might fit everyone and anyone. In a sense, the actual reading of the book starts at the end, in the last few pages where she explains her true intention: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she [Ernaux] will capture the lived dimension of History.” And the last sentence: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”  ","Azarin"
"Memories.","Alessio"
"I can’t say that this has really grabbed me — too many lists of names of French pop phenomena in the 60’s and 70’s and so on..., and the author’s choice of the collective pronoun (‘nous’) drains the text of any emotional immediacy. Others may like it better.","AC"
"Avoids the memoir pitfall of solipsism in the most lovely way. Wistful, melancholy, interweaves historical events and times, films, photographs, deaths of public figures, wars, with the life of a representative "everywoman" we understand to be the writer. The subtlety and honesty include specifics of her own class/relationships/career/family but in a way that draws one to see a certain universality among those of her generation. As someone from the next generation I still felt much of her creation of a tone or feeling of certain years or decades felt beautifully true. She understands her perspective is unavoidably not truly universal, particularly in terms of race, class, immigration status in the France she describes but nevertheless her voice captures feelings I'm certain were shared in varying degrees by many. Offers a scathing critique of the growing sense of individual as "consumer" and she does not exempt herself from this role. Looking back toward the arrogance of youth but with compassion for the child/young woman/older woman she has been. But also realistic about the illusions and lack of awareness we all experience. Brave and haunting.","Brooke Salaz"
"There is currently considerable confusion in the world of books and publishing, about the differences between a memoir and an autobiography. Unfortunately, Amazon's search engine combines the two genres, adding to the problem. A memoir focuses on an experience in an individual's life and can start anywhere and be written by anyone. In contrast, an autobiography is a historical document covering the trajectory of an entire life, starting at the beginning and progressing chronologically to its end. The Years is the collective history of Annie Ernaux's generation (She was born in 1940 in a small village in Normandy.) In Edmund White's review in The New York Times in January 2018, he described The Years as both "familiar and distancing." I found that Annie Ernaux wrote about her life as a third-person observer, by using only impersonal pronouns, either "we" or "she," "they" or "he." As a result she has created a sociological narrative of the generation born during World War II. While she is French, the broad themes she describes are familiar because they also affected Americans. This is in contrast to several of her earlier books which were intimate memoirs.","Joan Lieberman"
"4,5 she manages to break my heart every time","belljareads"
"A unique and lovely book telling the story of a woman through the story of the collective "we." A lyrical and moving attempt to "save something from the time where we will never be again."","Suju"
"This was a real treat. Before reading this, I knew next to nothing of life in France after the second World War. This is not like most memoirs, which move from concrete scene to concrete scene. Instead, this is very similar to how one remembers their own life. A narrative that slides through the years, giving you a sense of the time and happenings, punctuated sporadically by events or people. It's a real delight.","Neil"
"No I did not read this in French. I just can't find the English title in Goodreads.  I quite liked it and found it easy enough to read (which helps me like a book). But it wasn’t so easy that it was empty. I read it pretty quickly. if this took place in a country i obsess over (say Israel) it would have taken MUCH longer as i would have been running like a crazy person with all the cultural references and i’d be looking all of them up on wikipedia and then following links in those articles and so on. but i didn’t care too much about almost all the events, magazines, brands, politicians, etc. mentioned. there were a couple that captured my fancy — the bank massacre .. things like that. the most powerful aspect of the book for me was this: i felt i was getting an understanding of women that i haven’t really had before. maybe she has a way of describing things that resonated with me. her talk about blood. how blood ruled her life and her friends’ lives as teens. She wrote about this incredibly powerfully in a way that gave me insights I had lacked before.  there was a lot of suburban malaise social commentary in this book. and i liked that. but i didn’t love it. there were moments though, sentences, snippets where her observations were transcendent","Barak Kassar"
"I think it's really smart and ambitious that Ernaux decided to write memoir not only of her own life, but of her class and kind in France. It offers a priceless and fascinating view into the way the silent generation progressed through the years. It's a great primer in recent French history, as well as a story of universal struggle of a leftist in a country with imperialist concerns and the omnipresent threat of the ultra-right. A wonderful read but ultimately horrifying because so little changes and yet the world's pain grows along with its population.","Severine"

"The Years captures not just the author’s sense of her own life, but that of her family, her country, her generation. As she responds to a collection of images, which in turn inspire other recollections to emerge, Ernaux evokes both the sentiments of each era and a cultural critique based on hindsight. Particularly of note are her reflections on material culture, class, and capitalism as she moves from being a poor girl born during WWII through decades of social change and increased economic security.   Naturally, I found myself most drawn to her insights about the world events that took place during my own lifetime. But the text as a whole is full of personal, political, and critical insight into the 20th and early 21st century in the West.  #GoodreadsGiveaways","Amy Martin"
"I loved the visuals of this book. It begins with descriptions of photos or pictures not taken. Annie paints a picture of emotions and aesthetics during mundane or pivotal moments in her life. Since she is speaking from a perspective of living in France, the social references were a little lost on me. The book seemed to move slowly but then I found myself halfway through. It was a great subway read as it was really about nothing specific. Just life. Being present. Observing. Some people may find it unsatisfying but it was a book to just enjoy the act of reading. She has some really good one-liners too that make you think. The very last line of the book was an encouragement to photograph, paint, remember in whatever way you can, the special moments in life before they're gone:  "Save something from the time where we will never be again."","Autumn Kovach"
"Ambitious, epic, personal, stylistically innovative memoir. And very French!","Louise Aronson"
"I dnfed this book because although this was said to be translated, yet it still has a language barrier that I couldn't understand. To keep looking it up every few minutes was getting frustrating. I also did not like the way that this autobiography was written in individual sentence form or in very short paragraph form, it was confusing.  Sexual desire was compared to memories in the same breath as talking about grandparents and parents...bizarre. Things didn't seem to mesh well together or tie in well most of the time.  Some things that the author stated I didn't even understand such as , " To exist is to drink oneself without thirst."Huh?  Again, not sure if it a language barrier thing or the way it was written but I only made it a couple chapters before giving up. This is very rare for me , as you can see this is only my second dnf book out of almost 400. I did give this book to a friend, though, here's hoping that she enjoys it more!","Michelle"
"A well structured autobiography, told in short topical rather than chronological paragraphs, highlighting the growth of the author's consciousness over the past seventy years, against the evolving political, social, and cultural life of France and Europe. Some references to American trends and themes. The author is perceptive, intelligent, and secure in her identity and outlook. It was a pleasure to read a woman writer who has so much confidence in herself. The book made me want to review my own life in a similar manner.","Elizabeth Mclean"
"A collective memoir of public events happening outside of the life of the writer in France to commemorate her time of existence impersonally, starting in 1941 and continuing through 2006. The author uses memories and multi-media to convey the historical timeline told in third-person narrative. Moving, melancholic, and brilliant.","Jennifer"
"The latest Fitzcarraldo Editions Nobel Prize Winner  Book 2/13 for me from the Man Booker International 2019 longlist  She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History.  The Years, translated from Annie Ernaux's 2008 original (Les années) by Alison L. Strayer, is yet another masterpiece brought to English language readers by the UK's finest publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions.  The Years is a narrative of France from 1940 (Ernaux's birth) to 2006 told in "an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes", and in the unique auto-socio-biography style that she has developed. Ernaux herself has been always keen to emphasise that everything in the books is true: la seule écriture juste m'a paru être le refus de toute fiction et ce que j'ai appelé ensuite "l'autosociobiographie" parce que je me fonde presque toujours sur un rapport de soi à la réalité sociohistorique. https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article...  (translation: the only writing that seemed fair to me was that which refused fiction altogether, which I later called autosociobiographie because I nearly always placed myself at the meeting of self and sociohistorical reality.) and indeed The Years might perhaps best be described as a 'novel without fiction' as Javier Cercas describes many of his books in his essay (tr. Anne McLean) The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, including his The Impostor (tr. Frank Wynne), a book also longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, a prize for 'novels and short-stories'. Indeed Les années was published as 'un roman' in France but The Years under Fitzcarraldo's white covers (usually for essays) here, although UK ISBN registration covers 'essay', 'memoir', and 'literary fiction in translation', and the MBI judges are to be congratulated for acknowledging its eligibility.  The Years opens with a collage of images and memories from throughout the period of which below are a sample  All the images will disappear:  the woman who squatted to urinate in broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirts lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the café  the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with Georges Wilson in the film The Long Absence ... the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer’s, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks’ home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Céleste Albaret as she’d appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot ... the stranger of Termini Station in Rome, who half lowered the blind of his first-class compartment and in profile, hidden from the waist up, dandled his sex in the direction of the young women in the train on the opposite platform, leaning against the railings, chins in hands  the guy in a cinema ad for Paic Vaisselle dishwashing liquid, cheerfully breaking dirty dishes instead of washing them while an offscreen voice sternly intoned ‘That is not the solution!’ and the man, gazing at the audience in despair, asked ‘But what is the solution?’ ... the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way into sleep  the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone      They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.  The narration then switches to impressions of World War II, for the narrator not actual but received memories, imbibed during family get togethers:  The voices of the guests flowed together to compose the great narrative of collective events, which we came to believe we too had witnessed.  They never grew tired of talking about the winter of '42, the bone-chilling cold, the hunger and the swedes, the food provisions and the tobacco vouchers, the bombardments the aurora borealis that heralded the coming of the war the bicycles and carts on the road during the Debacle the looted shops the displaced searching the debris for their photos and their money the arrival of the Germans - every person at the table could say exactly where, in what city - and the always courteous English, the inconsiderate Americans, the collabos, the neighbour in the resistance, X's daughter whose head was shaved after the Liberation Le Havre razed to the ground, where nothing remained, the black market Propaganda the Krauts fleeing across the Seine at Caudebec on knackered horses the countrywoman who loudly farted in a train compartment full of Germans and proclaimed to all and sundry, 'If we can't tell it, we can make them smell it!'  From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events.  But they only spoke of what they had see and could re-live while eating and drinking. They lacked the talent and conviction to speak of things they'd been aware of but had not seen. Not the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the bodies of starvation victims collected every morning from the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degree fires in Hiroshima. Hence our impression, which later history courses, documentaries and films failed to dispel, that neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belong to the same era as black market butter, air-raid warnings, and descents to the cellar.  The line "everything was told in the 'we' voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone were equally affected by events" is key to Ernaux's own style in the book:  There is no "I" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only "one" and "we," as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time before.  The narrative is largely based on Ernaux's own life but she uses 'we' (*) not 'I', or 'she' when specifically referring to herself: her personal memories (auto) are used to both tell her own life story and her evolution as a writer, but also to describe the collective experience (biography) of her friends and indeed the generation of French women to which she belongs (and perhaps social class, ethnic group and artistic inclination as well), which in turn also becomes a (sociological) history of France itself - hence the auto-socio-biography.  (* as an aside, I believe the French original uses 'on' heavily, but Strayer has sensible avoids the use of 'one' in English, which would have conveyed a rather different impression)  Ernaux is the same Le Monde interview also argued that the use of "elle" rather than "je" actually allowed her a certain distancing and so to be more open about things that might other seem personally shameful:  J'ai l'impression que je la déjoue par une manière d'écrire impersonnelle, une façon de mettre à distance l'inavouable. J'ai pu parler pour la première fois de mes fils dans Les Années (Gallimard, 2008) parce que je disais "elle" et pas "je."  Another distinctive feature is how, in Ernaux's account, as is true in reality for most people, political events are often mere background, simply marking the turning of the years in much the same way as does, in another thread, the winner of each year's Tour de France. The story of France in the second half of the 20th Century is instead told, effectively, with the personal:  It is with the perception and sensations received by the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette that writing is able to retrieve here something slipping through the 1950s, to capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.  This reference to "the spectacled fourteen-and-a-half-year-old brunette" is from a described photo and Ernaux applies an inversion of the Sebaldian technique. Where he included, often uncommented, photos in his text, often ones he had discovered in junk shops but which fitted his narration, she often starts a new era of reminiscence with a photograph from her family album (later in the book, videos), but one described verbally to rather than physically seen by the reader. For example another photo taken by her young husband on a Sunday lunchtime:  In a photo taken indoors, a close-up in black and white, a young woman and a little boy sit side by side on a single bed, fitted out cushions to make a sofa. Behind them is a window with sheer curtains. An African artefact hangs on the wall. The woman wears an outfit in pale jersey, a twin set and a skirt just above the knee. Her hair, parted in dark asymmetrical bands, accentuates the full oval of her face. Her cheekbones are lifted in a big smile. Neither her hairstyle nor her outfit corresponds to the images one later saw of 1966 or 1967. Only the short skirt is consistent with the fashion launched by Mary Quant. ... On the back is written 'Rue Loverchy, Winter '67.' ... As lunch simmers flagrantly on the stove, and the babbling child assembled Lego blocks, and the toliet flusher is repaired while Bach's Musical Offering plays in the background, they build their collective sense, all in all, of being happy. The photo plays a role in this construction, anchoring their 'little family in the long term. It acts as a pledge of permanence for the child's grandparents, who will receive a copy.  Literature also plays an important role, another way to chart both the passing years (a wonderfully pithy passage on the fall of the Soviet Union The USSR, which we no longer thought about, shook the summer awake with a half-baked coup by old Stalinist fogies. Gorbachev was discredited, chaos declared and dismissed within hours, all because of a beady-eyed brute who, by some miracle, had clambered onto a tank and been hailed as the hero of freedom, concludes Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky) but also of the evolving taste as she matures.  For example, in the lead in to the student revolution in Paris of May 1968, one of the few events that really does impact on daily life:  Television, with its fixed iconography and minimal cast of actors, would institute a 'ne varietur' version of events, the unalterable impression that all of us had been eighteen to twenty-five that year and hurled cobblestones at the riot police, handkerchiefs pressed to our mouths. Bombarded by the recurrent camera images, we suppressed those of our own May ’68, neither momentous – the deserted Place de la Gare on a Sunday, no passengers, no newspapers in the kiosks – nor glorious – one day when we were afraid of lacking money, petrol, and especially food, rushing to the bank to withdraw cash and filling a cart to overflowing at Carrefour, from an inherited memory of hunger.  It was a spring like any other, sleet in April, Easter late. We’d followed the Winter Olympics with Jean-Claude Killy, read Elise, or The Real Life, proudly changed the R8 for a Fiat sedan, started Candide with the première students and paid only vague attention to the unrest at Paris universities, reported on the radio.  But the Sorbonne closed, the written exams for the CAPES were cancelled, and students clashed with police. One night, we heard breathless voices on Europe 1. There were barricades in the Latin Quarter, as in Algiers ten years earlier, Molotov cocktails and wounded. Now we were aware that something was happening and did not feel like returning to life as usual the next day.  The reference to the events in Paris in 1968 (my birth year), which were not particularly echoed in the UK, emphasises the point that the book can't help but read differently to an Englishman of a younger generation than to a Frenchwoman of Ernaux's own, the national differences in terms of references to celebrities, adverts and branded products perhaps most noticeable: there is less of nod of constant recognition as there would be to Ernaux's own compatriots. However, the experience is equally effective, indeed it is fascinating to see which things are common and which different.  Strayer makes effective although very sparing use of footnotes (just 29 in the 227 page book), for example to explain that CAPES in the quote above is the Certificat d’aptitude au professeur de l’enseignement du second degré, the secondary teachers’ training certificate. Indeed at times I wondered why one particular cultural reference was explained out of a dozen in the same paragraph, although I suspect cases where Google would not help may be one reason. An interview and article with Strayer reported: Strayer has learned some tricks along the way, including visits to some of Monsieur Google’s more obscure domains. It also helps to be living in Paris with a French husband whose family could apparently win any French Trivial Pursuit contest.  “I had only to present a snippet of a popular song, an advertising jingle, joke or spoonerism, a quip from a ‘50s comedian, whatever the case, and someone would promptly recite it in full and provide necessary explanations,” Strayer said in a recent email interview. https://artsfile.ca/ex-pat-ottawa-tra...  And a final impressive feature of the novel, and a thread that runs through it, is Ernaux charting her developing thoughts on writing a book of her life, the book that eventually we are now reading. Her preferred form evolves from a Proust-like tome, to, this its final form:  It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.  Highly recommended and definite shortlist material for me for the MBI, indeed it would make a worthy winner.","Paul Fulcher"

"A new experience in autobiography...is there a word for an autobiography of an "us?" The experience of reading Ernaux's The Years seems to define it for me. I read in bed caught by the "we" of her story which, while noting in my mind that she is upper class French and the setting is France and I am from a small-town, shallow experience in the US, the epic of my own life swept before me like a long dream. She shies away from feelings but they came over and over like waves to the surface. It wasn't that I couldn't put it down, from time to time I had to. Most of the time the names and places she used were only vaguely familiar, the scenery beside the point. I was there, this was my story told in the most marvelous way.","Sandra"

"Ernaux has created her own genre – neither memoir nor autobiography - rather a short biography of the generation who has lived from 1941 to 2006. A photograph of “she” is the starting point of each section furnished with snippets of language, advertising, popular song and table talk which give a sense of time’s passage and with it, the evolution of our bodies and minds. She is particularly critical of “the rapid arrival of new things (which) drove away the past” because “the profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs”. Yet neither “she” nor “we” can resist the zeitgeist of our changing times, so the French society of deprivation after the war gives itself over incrementally to goods, ideas, language and songs emanating from the United Kingdom and United States, while at the same time despising themselves for these accommodations to contemporary taste.

"Annie's diary covering the years from 1940 to 2006; roughly my peer. Although she talks about growing up and living in France, there are enough parallels between her life and mine as as American female as she watches and analyzes the decades morph and change. The world has changed dramatically from WWII until now, so I can relate to her observations.  “She often revisits images of herself single, in the streets of the cities where she has walked and in the rooms that she has occupied – in a young ladies’ hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair, or in a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The object of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: ‘Out of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not’”… pg 94  “She has lost her sense of the future, a kind of limitless background on which her actions and gestures were once projected, a waiting for all the good and unknown things that lived inside her…” pg 227  ","Candice"
"A strange book. Less straightforward than “La Place” or “Une Femme”, but shares the ambiguity of personal/impersonal. This is a life in time, in memory, a book to be written towards the end of earthly existence, like “reviews of the century” in the media in December 1999. There’s no “je”, it’s “on”, “elle”, “nous”; personal names are omitted for her own circle, so it is more the history of a section of French society, women born towards the end of WWII, moving from a modest background in the provinces to the Parisian region and greater affluence in “interesting times”, left-leaning, losing Catholic faith and connection with parents in the process. It did have resonance for me, though I’m a good few years younger, as I do remember most of those years, and either recall those landmarks in France (having been Francophile since 1968) or link them with similar events in the UK that stick in the mind as turning points, tragedies or moments of hope. I’d have included more of myself if I were to review my life as it nears its end - triumphs as well as regrets - but that’s not Ernaux’s style. My book wouldn’t find a publisher! ","Trish"
"Annie Ernaux, born in 1940, lived through the most extraordinary period of political, social, and economic change. In this memoir, she tells her life through photographs taken throughout her life, short video clips and recordings, but also through the books she read, the rise of consumer culture, and the very essence of the spirit of the times in which she lived. For the reader, she is there and not there, because she uses the universal “we” to refer to both herself and collective experience. The book has no dialogue, and all of the people in her life (grandparents, parents, husband, children, lovers, grandchildren) remain nameless and elusive. I was taken by how so much of the book resembled similar change in the United States: the elders who spoke of war and hunger, versus the young who barely can stand the boredom of it all. The book is a memoir as much of Ernaux as it is a picture of France over a sixty-seven year period (the book begins with the 1940s and ends in 2007). Much of the book deals with the politics and politicians of her lifetime, and the major upheavals in France in her adulthood (May 1968 and the issues of the poor who live outside of the periphery of Paris). I think the best take away is to remember that what we will have at the end of our lives will be fleeing images and feelings from our personal and collective past, and they should be saved and treasured, as we will never return to those moments again.","Caterina Pierre"
"Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’ set between 1940 and 1985…And how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?  Les Années (The Years) is Annie Ernaux’s memoir of her life. In the end, for reasons she explains as the book progresses, it doesn’t cover just the period from 1940 (her birth) to 1985, but carries on all the way to 2006.  But this is not a standard memoir. As it finishes, Ernaux recalls the time when she finally felt ready to commit it to paper and she says  This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes all the way to the final image of a life.  And so Ernaux sets out to capture memory, impressions past and present, cultural habits, language, photos, books, songs, radio, television, advertising and news headlines (from the back cover of the English edition from Fitzcarraldo Editions, which goes on to describe the book as at the confluence of autofiction and sociology). She tracks through her life using photographs from family albums to break the narrative into sections (the photographs are described in the text, not shown as images).  And it is a completely compelling review of a life and of a country. Given that Ernaux is 20 years my senior and grew up in a different country, I was rather taken by surprise at how absorbed I became in watching her grow from childhood to womanhood while all around her France (and the world) moved through the cultural and technological revolutions of the second half of the twentieth century. I even gave a little cheer when she writes specifically about 14 July 1989. I know this date well as it was the day on which the younger of my two sons was born. Somehow, Ernaux’s writing seems to capture the culture and the mood of each decade as well as the gradually developing thoughts and attitudes of a woman.  Despite being male, English and twenty years younger than Ernaux, I loved reading this.  4.5 stars and I’m tempted to break my rule about not rounding up to 5 stars. I’ll think about it.  PS As an aside, I think this book would make a perfect companion piece to Virginie Despentes’ Vernon Subutex trilogy. The Subtex novels explore the culture and attitudes of modern day France and this book gives a perfect primer on the development of these over the preceding 60 years.","Neil"

"Having originally read the book in January this year, I revisited Annie Ernaux’s The Years (translated by Alison L. Strayer) due to its inclusion on the Man Booker International 2019 longlist. This collective autobiography “at the confluence of autofiction and sociology,” as the cover blurbs it, was certainly worth revisiting. It’s an impressive perusal of French culture and society as viewed through the lens of one writer, written in a memorable and inventive way.  What ultimately makes this flout the nonfiction category – and therefore making it eligible for fiction awards which it has already won in France – is the humble fact that, of course, Ernaux is unable to write in a completely factual manner about France in, say, the 1940s. In terms of the autobiography genre, how could she write accurately about a period of time when she was less than ten years old? I like this approach because it reminds me of how all that’s categorizable as nonfiction is based on interpretation. Text analysis 101. It’s something that Rachel Cusk addresses magnificently in her Faye trilogy.  So what we have in The Years are impressions, fleeting moments from one woman’s history captured in ephemeral language. There’s anxiety about memories soon vanishing – Ernaux was nearing her seventies when the book was first published in 2008:  Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.  From this vantage point, Ernaux sets out to chronologically chart a cultural history of France from her birth in early 1940s to 2006, but this history is evidently partial. She employs a plural voice – a we-narrator, which raises questions of translation that I won’t touch upon here more than to say that in the French original the word used is the more complex ‘on’ and not ‘nous’ – which suggests that these events have happened not only to her but basically to every woman in France. But I don’t think that’s what Ernaux is trying to convey; I think she’s more nuanced than that. Near the beginning of the book, in the context of war-ravaged France, the narrator remarks:  From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’ voice and with impersonal pronouns, as if everyone was equally affected by events.  Perhaps that’s what evokes the more passive ‘on’ narration for the rest of the book. And it’s a beautiful read. Through glimpses of seemingly unimportant details such as advertisements, Ernaux evokes a compelling picture of life lived in a certain time and of the changes that society goes through over the course of decades. It decentres narratives of war and politics by highlighting the personal and collective spaces of women. It’s saturated with references to 20th-century French culture, which is the only pitfall of the book for a reader like me with negligible knowledge of the subject matter, but I think Ernaux succeeds nonetheless in telling a deeply affecting story, one that I will remember.  (Appears on my newly launched blog Literary Noise. My first “review” from January 2019 is below.)  ---  Wonderfully written and touching. Interesting use of a we-narrator: what are the ethical implications of narrating events as if they happened to / were experienced by every woman in France 1941–2006? Obviously it’s an aesthetic choice and I quite enjoyed it.","Tommi"

"I read this because it is a memoir. I read memoirs and autobiographies as aids to the book I am writing, either a memoir or an autobiography depending on which day you ask. When I first heard about The Years, I learned that this acclaimed French writer covers her life against a background of social and political French life, comparing and relating her passages to those events. I am attempting a similar feat.  Unlike myself, Annie Ernaux is exemplary in her brevity. She manages to compress 1941 to 2006 into just a bit over 200 pages. Reading the book was like watching a newsreel, barreling through her upbringing, her schooling and her adult life, complete with the major news, the literature, music, movies and changing styles and mores.  At times she is remembering her world by looking outside herself, other times by recalling her emotions and observations. Since I have never lived in France, many of the cultural bits were outside my experience. That problem was eased by the fact that we have both been through these changes simply by living in the world during almost the same decades.  She often mentions Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre, and other French authors I have read, making me feel more at home. I have read from those authors about the German occupation during WWII, the resistance, the Algerian War, the involvement of French intellectuals and youth with socialism and communism. New to me though was what has happened in France from the 1970s on.  The book was a great boost to my own writing project. Unless other readers are interested in mid 20th century French life, it might be less interesting. If you have visited France over the years though, it is an inside look into changes you may have noticed.  Just as I was reading it, The Years was included on the long list for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, another bonus for book nerds.","Judy"
"Autobiographical novel with interesting POV (with which I had some big problems) is told in snippets, from postwar years till present time.

"What an original, unconventional way to tell one's life story! The Years is a relentless stream of memories - sometimes random or disjointed, but always impersonal. More of a brief history of France in the second half of the 20th century than an autobiography per se. There is no story to speak of, there are no plot or characters or dialogue. Instead, there are dozens of lists (which I'm not fond of), dozens of descriptions of photographs (which I'm even less fond of), and hundreds of references to French popular culture & politics going back to the 40's (which went completely over my head, what with not being French and not belonging to the same generation as Annie Ernaux). I walked away feeling oddly indifferent. I am sure there is some sort of value in all this, so I won't question the merit of the book. Just that perhaps I am the wrong audience for it.","Iulia"
"VERDICT: An impressive personal and collective memoir of the first half of the 20th century. A contemporary masterwork. I already mentioned that The Man Booker International 2019 Shadow Panel made me discover a French author unknown to me. I’m very happy to present another one today. I had heard about Annie Ernaux, but had never read The Years, nor anything by her. It’s sad that in all my studies in France, I was not exposed to contemporary authors like her (she was born in 1940), even though she won a lot of literary awards. And this is so good! Hang on, this is going to be a long review, but hopefully, you will jump on the book right after reading my prose!  And indeed, The Years is definitely a book you have to read if you are interested in France and French literature, or any good contemporary literature. In only 237 pages (in the English translation, and 253 pages in the French folio edition), Annie Ernaux manages to present an impressive fresco of roughly the second half of the 20th century –from WWII to 2006 to be more specific.

"Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2019  This is a very enjoyable "impersonal autobiography", which mixes Ernaux's own life story with a form of collective consciousness recalling the events of her lifetime in France and how they were perceived more widely across her generation.  I do have a certain amount of sympathy for those who feel that something so close to non-fiction should not be competing for a fiction prize, and Fitzcarraldo's own decision to give it a white cover does not help, but I still found it an interesting read, and would probably not have read it had it not been longlisted for the prize.  The French focus meant that plenty of the cultural reference points were unfamiliar, as was some of the political history (Ernaux's sympathies are with the left, so her views on the "evenements" of May 1968 and the election of Francois Mitterand and how he subsequently became deradicalised, and the rise of Le Pen were interesting).","Hugh"
"*Now a deserving Nobel Laureate. This is one of best books I have read.*    "We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be."   I love the International Booker Prize's new version. They always have at least a couple of gems in their long list. And this book is such a gem. You could start introducing it by saying that it is an autobiography, however, it isn't just biography of a single person, rather it is a biography of a whole French generation born around 1940. Since the industrial revolution, generational differences have widened exponentially. And a single person can live to see the world change many times in his or her life and that is the case with the generation the author talks about. The generation which is the protagonist of the novel (the pronoun used is 'we') was raised in a peasant conservative family and grew up through second world war, cold war, death of philosophers (philosophers are to French what babas are to Indians and authors are to Russians) liberalization of economy, metro, consumerisation of society, television, sexual revolution, computers, mobiles, 9/11 attacks etc. And it is the story of the author or people her age (she was born in 1940) went through those changes.  One of the motivations behind writing the book seems to be fear of being forgotten. The book starts talking about images will be forgotten.   "Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [. . .]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful . . ." —Anton Chekhov (one of the epigraphs   I think people feel this fear far more than they did earlier. It could be one of the reasons behind the click-happy culture that is developing the world over. The author regularly goes back to look back at her old pictures and talk about her memories of those times.  The next generations will just take for granted the very things they had to fight for. There are people who are jealous of their earlier generation who supposedly lived in 'simpler' times, I myself am jealous of future generations who will be born taking such things like internet and free books for granted and will have so much more to explore (provided global warming or Trump don't destroy the world of course):   "The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die."   The book goes from the time of the birth of author to the moment till she has found her inspiration. In the last parts she is already thinking of writing the book:   "She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between “I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust."   Most of the book is quotable but here are a few: Change of Values over time   "Some sentiments fell out of use, ones we no longer felt and found absurd, such as patriotism and honor, reserved for inferior times and abused populations. Shame, invoked at every turn, was a shadow of its former self—a passing aggravation, a short-lived wound to the ego. “Respect,” first and foremost, was the demand of that same ego for the recognition of others. One no longer heard the words “goodness” or “good people.” Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was—female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab, etc."     "They pinned a button on their backpacks, the image of a black suitcase and the slogan Who’s next? They tucked it in a drawer at home as a memento. They signed petitions and forgot the cause, forgot they’d even signed them—who was Abu-Jamal, again? Then, overnight, their energy flagged. Effusion alternated with anomie, protest with consent. The word “struggle” was discredited as a throwback to Marxism, become an object of ridicule. As for “defending rights,” the first that came to mind were those of the consumer."   Development of language   "We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions.” No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted. Between “addiction,” “resilience,” and “grief work,” there were countless ways of transposing life and emotions into words. Depression, alcoholism, frigidity, anorexia, unhappy childhoods, nothing was lived in vain anymore. The communication of experience and fantasies was pleasing to the conscience. Collective introspection provided models for putting the self into words. The repertoire of shared knowledge grew. The mind grew more agile, children learned at a younger age, and the slowness of school drove young people to distraction. They texted on their mobiles full tilt."   On arrival of television   "Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. The elderly turned it on at noon when the broadcast day began and fell asleep at night in front of the test pattern. In winter, the pious had only to watch The Lord’s Day to attend Mass at home. Housewives ironed while watching the soap operas on channel 1, or Madame Today on 2. Mothers kept children quiet with Les visiteurs du mercredi and The Wonderful World of Disney. For everyone, TV spelled the availability of immediate, low-cost distraction and peace of mind for wives, who were able to keep their husbands home on Sundays with the televised sports. It surrounded us with a constant and impalpable solicitude that bobbed along on the unanimously smiling and understanding faces of the show hosts (Jacques Martin and Stéphane Collaro), their easy affability (Bernard Pivot, Alain Decaux). We were increasingly united by the same curiosities, fears, and satisfaction."   On the arrival of Walkman (my favorite quote)   "With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world."   On arrival of Internet   "The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time. In less than two minutes, one could locate classmates from Camille Jullian high school in Bordeaux, second C2 class, 1980 to 1981, a song by Marie-Josée Neuville, an article from 1988 in L’Humanité. The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we’d never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through the odor and yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present."   On click-happy culture   "We never stopped wanting to click on “save” and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, new social use of photos. They were transferred and filed in seldom-opened folders on the computer. What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded as we were living it—cherry trees in bloom, a hotel room in Strasbourg, a baby minutes after birth, places, events, scenes, objects, the complete conservation of life. With digital technology, we drained reality dry."   Commercialisation   "Commercial time invaded calendar time with renewed vigor. Christmas already, people sighed as toys and chocolate besieged the hypermarkets, just after All Saints’ weekend. They were depressed, already feeling the vise-grip of the holiday season, which forced one to think of oneself, one’s loneliness and purchasing power as compared to the rest of society—as if Christmas night were the crowning moment and end of all existence. It was a vision that made us want to go to sleep in November and wake up in the new year. We entered the most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year. With loathing we stood in overheated lines, and performed the consumer act like a sacrifice, a duty of spending offered up to who-knows-what god in the name of who-knows-what salvation. Resigned to “doing something for Christmas,” we bought decorations for the tree and planned the menu for the holiday meal."     "In the middle of that first decade of the twenty-first century, which we never referred to as “the noughties,” at the table where we’d gathered the children, now getting on forty (though with their jeans and Converse sneakers they still looked like teens), and their partners—the same for several years now—and the grandchildren, and also a man who’d graduated from transitional secret lover to stable companion, eligible for family gatherings, conversation began with a swarm of back-and-forth questions about work, insecure or threatened by downsizing as a result of new ownership, modes of transport, schedules, holidays, how many cigarettes a day and quitting, leisure activities, photo and music downloads, recent purchases of new objects, the latest version of Windows, the latest model of mobile phone, 3G, attitudes toward consumption and time management, everything that helped them refresh their knowledge of one another, assess the other’s lifestyle while privately confirming the excellence of their own."   Still true for Indians  You could argue that most of East still lags behind by a couple of generation from the west. And Indians will find the following quotes relatable:   "For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large over their clothing and makeup: too short, long, low-cut, tight, flashy, etc. The height of their heels, whom they saw, what time they went out and came in, the crotch of their underwear, month after month, were subject to all-pervasive surveillance by society."     "At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think—no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories—are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form." ","Sidharth Vardhan"
"MBI2019 Book 6/13  I liked what the author was trying to achieve with her narrative technique but felt the execution was too limited, you need to be the same age, gender and nationality to fully appreciate everything.  Full review here soon https://thereadersroom.org/","Book Wormy"
"This memoir by a well-known French writer won a number of awards, including the 2018 French-American Foundation Translation Prize in Nonfiction. It tells the author’s story, from her childhood in 1940s post-war France to 2006. It is not just her story but also the story of her class and her generation, much of it told in snippets (“abbreviated memories”) and lists and with reference to photos, as if the author were rummaging through an old family album. It is well done for the most part, but readers who did not come of age in France during these years will not understand all of the references to individuals, historical moments, and movements. Her writing style, which relies heavily on the fragments of her memory, also gets a bit tiresome.","Robert B"
"I like the idea of building a record of a life through a mixture of family memories and snapshot cultural references and Annie Ernaux has put them together well. Many of the cultural references were unfamiliar to me, however meaningful to the author, although even when I could not relate to the cultural details, I enjoyed reading about her life in this unusual, autofictional form. The references in the later years of the book are more international and political. They also correspond with years I was alive, so these were more familiar than the childhood memories. I think I would have liked to meet Annie Ernaux, or listened to her discussing culture, politics and social mobility.","Val"
"This is the of the 13 books on the 2019 MBI longlist I have read. I finished reading, closed the book, and started to cry.  This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen - perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.  It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being - freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the 'she' of writing.  There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to the story of the time-before.  … There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save  [list of 14 things]  To save something from the time where we will never be again.  That is what the author says about her book and that is exactly what it is. Yes, there are many French-specific events and things that I knew nothing about. But there were also many global events that I did know something about. The thrust of this book was relentlessly forward, as the author says "devouring the present as it goes." In 2006, she was 66 years old and had devoured a lot of the present, taking the reader with her on a journey that goes faster and faster as things change faster and faster. Then, at the end, we find out her purpose -- "To save something from the time where we will never be again." And that is the point. ","LindaJ^"
"They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.   The nomination of Annie Ernaux's The Years (translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer) for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize stirred up some heated discussions in some corners of the bookish internet on whether the book should have even been eligible for the prize since it's essentially an autobiography, comprised of the author's own memories and even some family photos.  From the outset, and judging from the description, I must admit that I was inclined to side with the people who said "No", however,  after reading the book and reflecting on it in more depth, my opinion changed and I think that such unconventional narratives do have a place among the nominees for a fiction prize, particularly, a prize for translated fiction which should (ideally) showcase not just different perspectives, experiences, and cultural traditions from around the world, but also the variety of narrative structures and writing styles that exist in world literature. Isn't this one of the reasons why so many of us are interested in translated fiction?  In an interview for The Guardian, French author Annie Ernaux describes The Years as a "collective history via my feelings and recollections" and it exists on a tentative border between non-fiction and fiction. Ernaux uses the first-person plural personal pronoun "we" and the gender-neutral pronoun "one", and, in some parts of the narrative, refers to herself in the third person as "she" to create a rather unconventional autobiographical novel that tries to encompass the experiences of a whole generation of French women. Instead of solely focusing on her own memories, the author places her personal experiences within the context of her generation, simultaneously challenging existing stereotypes about memoirs written by women and providing fascinating insights into the lives of ordinary people in post-war France.  The Years is written as a continuous, easily-flowing narrative, comprised of personal memories, historical events, and pop culture references that together form a nuanced account of the various political, social and cultural transformations that France went through after World War II. As opposed to more conventional memoirs, the central character of The Years seems to be time itself, and the story focuses on how the passing and fleeting nature of time and significant historical events over the period of 60 years affected the lives of the whole post-war generation, mixed with scenes and elements from Ernaux's individual life that briefly interrupt the impersonal narrative.   It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being – freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.   Ernaux masterfully interweaves her personal memories into this collective narrative,  however, due to the unusual way that the story is told, some readers might find this book somewhat unemotional. Ernaux gives us a glimpse into some of the key moments in her life, but she doesn't go into much detail about these events and how they affected her emotionally, and, while I think that this was an intentional choice that was also an integral part in upholding her vision of creating a "collective autobiography" of her generation, I suspect that, for those, who aren't very familiar or particularly interested in the history of modern France, this book might seem a bit flat and cerebral. For me, it worked and I found it to be a very compelling and thought-provoking read, but, then again, I'm not a big fan of traditional autobiographies.  The Years definitely deserves all the praise that it has already received, and I'm glad that it made it onto the 2019 Man Booker International Prize longlist (and shortlist!) because I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I'm convinced that I need to explore more of Ernaux's work.","Agnese"

"When this year’s Man Booker International Prize longlist was announced it included French book “The Years” by Annie Ernaux. Some people scratched their heads at its inclusion – not because of its perceived quality – but because the English version was published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo with their recognizable plain white covers and blue lettering. This signifies it’s a book of essays or nonfiction (as opposed to their plain blue covers with white lettering which signifies it’s a work of fiction.) But the Man Booker International Prize is only open to fiction. What gives? Well, when “The Years” first appeared in its native French language it was classified as a novel. So apparently Fitzcarraldo asked the Booker if “The Years” could be submitted as a novel even though they originally classified it as nonfiction. The Booker accepted.  This titbit of gossip doesn’t matter, but it shows how the form of “The Years” doesn’t follow any neat classification. It’s part fiction, part essay, part autobiography. Personally, I don’t care how books are categorized or which shelf they sit on in a bookstore. What is important is how this revolutionary book conveys a sense of history, consciousness and national identity like no other book I’ve read before. Narrated in a unique collective “we” voice it follows a woman and those around her from post-WWII through to the current Information Age. In doing so it provides such a unique shifting sense of time as it speaks from the perspective of people in an era of rapid change. Also it regularly focuses on jarringly precise details that come close to poetry. Somehow it achieves the startling feat of being both intimately personal while also speaking as the collective voice of a generation. It’s extraordinary, beautiful and warrants prizes no matter what label it’s published under.  Read my full review of The Years by Annie Ernaux on LonesomeReader","Eric Anderson"
"(4.5) Annie Ernaux is a legend in French literature and The Years makes it easy to see why. I’m grateful this was translated into English so we can all experience her writing. The Years is a capsule of French society, culture, and history - spanning from the year just after Ernaux was born, 1941, up to 2006. Commentary on gender, politics, memory, and culture are all meditated upon here. What makes The Years so unique and stunning is that it is a time capsule via an autobiography; both intimate and universal at the same time. ⁣⁣Ernaux refers to herself as "she", and the rest of the book moves through history by referencing a "we". It is a 𝘴𝘶𝘪 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴 manner of playing with language.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I learned so much from this book; I made the effort to keep my phone nearby and pulled up to Google while reading so I could look up French cultural references, famous people, or slang I did not know. I would advise doing this as well - it will provide more context and understanding, improve the overall reading experience, and perhaps one day help you win a Jeopardy question!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Reading more French literature is on my literary goals list and this was a wonderful re-introduction to the genre. Now, if I only I can finally get through Proust... Ernaux does a wonderful job at elegantly navigating the passing of time in her writing, like her earlier male counterpart aforementioned - although of course, she uses many fewer words to do so 😜 Ernaux’s description of the "palimpsest sensation" regarding the movement of time is glorious and you can look forward to reading about it. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I wish a version of The Years existed for all the places I love and all the places I want to visit. It made me wonder what an American version would be like. This one is so deserving of its spot on the Man Booker International Prize shortlist.","Cassie (book__gal)"
""There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before...to save something from the time we will never be again."  A genre-bending masterpiece. History book, autobiography, novel (if all life is a fiction), exploration of memory. This isn't just Annie Ernaux's autobiography, it is also that of anyone who has lived in these times.  Making notes of what she remembers from 1941 to 2006, Ernaux never writes about the "I", it is always, "she", as if she stands outside of the life she has lived to reconstitute "a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present." It is an unsentimental account that delves very rarely in the "personal" of Ernaux's life as if she was unable to separate the world from the individual. I found this a great relief.  Although her personal narrative takes place in France, the growing up and through global and common human events makes this book resonate on a very deep personal level. Politics, revolution, sex, marriage, children, friendships, capitalism, the internet, you name it, Ernaux explores it with such incisive wisdom, it is hard to escape the times we have lived through and are living now.  Here she is in her sixties talking about her parenting of grown children: "She continues to contribute to her children's material welfare to compensate for any pain they might endure in their lives, for which she feels responsible, having brought them into the world."  The "she" is Ernaux but it is also me. As is the "she" in so much of this book.  About politics in the 2000s: "We didn't quite know what was wearing us down the most, the media and their opinion polls, 'who do you trust', their condescending comments, the politicians with their promises to reduce unemployment and plug the hole in the social security budget, or the escalator at the RER station that was always out of order, the lines at Carrefour and the post office, all those things that make it as futile to put a ballot in a ballot box as a contest entry form into a drum at the shopping centre."  Recognizable? Whatever country you live in, she captures the "markers of an epoch."  About the Internet: "Talk to strangers, insult and chat them up, invent a self. They were disembodied, voiceless, devoid of odour or gesture; they didn't get under our skin...We made our way around a world of objects without subjects. The internet engineered the dazzling transformation of the world into discourse. The quick jump-click of the mouse on the screen was the measure of time."  Close to the beginning of this book, Ernaux writes what I perceived as her view of the "self" we all imagine ourselves to be and reading this paragraph gave me an inkling that in reading this book I would be embarking on an unusual but welcome journey with this author.  She writes: "Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation."  Well, that articulation just brought me joy.  Astonishing achievement. Highly recommended.","Wendy"

"I wasn't sure about this book at first, but the more I read the more I fell in love... This life story, in style and structure, is unlike any other. Through a series of vignettes - historical and personal events, commentaries and trends, experiences and memories, pictures and images - Annie Ernaux masterfully travels in time and takes us on this incredibly detached yet extremely intimate voyage of years past, what is left behind and what is to come. A social and generational critique where milestones, moments and thoughts easily - or wishfully - forgettable, ephemeral, are captured and salvaged, like secrets exposed. Pieced together, we come to realize Les années (The Years) is more than one person's tale, it is anyone and everyone's tale on paper, now forever alive... ","MJ Beauchamp"
"A few passages from The Years:   Like sexual desire, memory never stops.   Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, “So that’s how it is – nothing will ever change.”   For the first time you could listen to music anywhere, whether one was lying on the beach with the radio next to one’s head, or walking down the street. The joy of the transistor was of an unknown species. One could be alone but not alone, and have at one’s command the noise and diversity of the world.   We were provided with sources of diversion, the Hula-Hoop and wholesome reading for young adults, but were not allowed to do anything that mattered, neither vote not make love, or even state an opinion. To have the right to be heard, one first had to prove one’s ability to blend in with the dominant social model…   We were expected to perpetuate tradition as a matter of course. In the face of this compulsory future, we vaguely yearned to stay young for a long, long time.   The thing most forbidden, the one we’d never believed possible, the contraceptive pill became legal. We didn’t dare ask the doctor for a prescription and the doctor didn’t offer, especially if one wasn’t married – that would be indecent. We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.   It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, devouring the present as it goes…   ","Jacob Wren"
"This is an interesting read, but very oriented toward French cultural and political history. Ernaux is more interesting to this American reader when she writes of those aspects of moving through life that are more universal, but there's still a sort of scattershot aspect to the march through time that seems a little rote.","Michael"
"The Years is a slender book, but feels epic, spanning 70-years during the author's coming of age and life in France. While I can't deny that many of the major political events, figures, and movements felt foreign to me as an American, what makes The Years absorbing and unique is they way Ernaux captures a nation's feelings and experiences in relation to significant historic events, and renders them as universal. Through an inventive and original form of "collective autobiography" she presents, as she puts it, “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” It's a style that immediately sucks you in and makes you feel like an empathetic participant, even if you're an outsider.  For such an intellectual work, The Years could have been stuffy and impenetrable, but instead finds the right balance between niche, European, auto-fic and accessible, mainstream memoir. This is a book in which you can find the author's thoughts on French society, history, and politics bumping up against modern cultural touch-points like H&M shopping, mobile phones, the early internet, and Playstation. Add to that Ernaux's stunning prose and perceptive observations, and you have one of the smartest and most captivating non-fiction works of the year.  It's tough to pick a favorite passage, but one for me of many:  "The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die."","Joe M"
"Thank you so much @fitzcarraldoeditions for sending me this masterpiece of a memoir to review, and congratulations on having it shortlisted, as it deserves to be! I wouldn’t have thought that a history of France between 1941-2006 disguised as a memoir would affect me so deeply, but I was honestly mesmerised by this book. . It is both structurally and stylistically brilliant (and elegantly translated by Alison L Strayer - she handles the sheer amount of French culture beautifully), with Ernaux capturing the culture, politics and history of France through the decades in a sort of collective autobiography, smattered throughout with snapshots of her own life. Although we do follow Ernaux’s personal life, it’s the history of France that had me captivated. . I will warn you that, obviously, The Years is just filled with references to French politics, politicians, adverts, films, songs, TV programmes, news headlines, so if you’re adverse to lots of Googling in between reading then I wouldn’t recommend this one because you might feel a bit lost. But if you do want to find out more about 20th century France then pick it up. I studied French at GCSE, A Level and University (should be reading it in French lol, French books are expensive!) and so a lot of the references I already was aware of, which definitely made it a smoother reading experience for me personally. . The mix of private and communal is just something I’ve never encountered before, making this book one of the most unique I’ve ever read. The juxtaposition of Ernaux describing her first sexual awakening in the third person with the vast sense of collective unease or euphoria at certain points in France’s history shouldn’t work but it just does. And she doesn’t shy away from exposing the weaknesses in French politics and community, for example the racism that pervades towards the banlieues. . I never thought I’d see myself give a memoir of sorts five stars, but here we are. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece (and yet it is weird that I wouldn’t recommend it blindly to everyone - know what you’re in for and if you know you don’t want to be Googling all sorts during it then maybe avoid it) ","Abbie | ab_reads"
"This book definitely has a different flavour to it. Although it is an autobiography, I got the feeling that Ernaux feels very disconnected from her own life. Almost as if society and the times are chugging along while she is half awake & meagrely trying to keep up. Through reading this, I was able to sympathize with the older generations who may feel lost in our modern world. This book is clunky- but in a good way. The reader may be confused as to why the author is talking about one thing than all of a sudden switches to another - yet this is how our brains work. Human memory and consciousness is not one, neat paragraph of organized ideas. Instead we have random thoughts popping into our head with one thought leading to another.  The author also demonstrates the contradictions of generations and genders. Why is it that as a teenager she is shamed for even dressing in a way that may be considered sexual, while it is acceptable for her sons to audibly have sex in the room beside her? Why is her entire value as a wife based on her virginity as a teenager? Why are women so eternally dependent on a male controlling their life? These are some of the questions raised in this thought provoking novel.  It is not easy to seamlessly weave together over fifty years of personal and cultural history. However Ernaux does so skillfully, and even ties a ribbon on top.","Brianna"
""The Years" is a memoir written by Annie Ernaux and translated from French to English by Alison L. Strayer. It spans the life of the author from her birth in 1940 up to the age of sixty-six.  Unlike the usual memoirs, this book is more on the collective history and experience rather than personal. The author tells the story using a stream of consciousness format and seamlessly shifts perspectives - from "We" to "She" and vice versa. Personally, I find this book to be quite odd considering that this is a memoir and is supposed to be personal yet it has an air of detachment between the author and her story which makes it quite hard for me as a reader to fully connect with her.  On the other hand, the writing is truly beautiful and fluid. I guess that since I'm not French and don't have enough understanding of the context behind the events, names, and other details which were mentioned in the book, I can't fully grasp nor appreciate it as a whole. However, it did impress upon me a sense of nostalgia which lingered for days after I've read it. I particularly liked how the author portrayed some traditions such as family gatherings and the sharing of experiences over a table of food and drinks, thereby continuing the cycle and thread of history.  Furthermore, there are lots of topics touched on in this book ranging from feminism, sexuality, reproductive health, immigration, capitalism, wars, and technology advancement. It depicts how people's perspectives about these things have changed over time and their impact in society. It's also notable how people's attitude vary from emphatic to apathetic depending on whether or not the circumstances surrounding an issue or event directly affect them and their self-serving view of society as a whole.  It's definitely an interesting read and I now get why this is book is a strong contender for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize.","Jasmine"
"I enjoy historical non-fiction so I did find plenty of interest in this part personal memoir/ part collective- autobiographical reflection on French society and history from 1941-2006, which I came to via its Man Booker Prize International longlisting – the jury there deciding that if the main prize jury can count comics as novels, then they can count non-fiction as fiction.  Interestingly one of the recurrent themes of the author’s reflections are on her lifelong ambition to write a novel – for example   “the idea has come to her to write a “kind of woman’s destiny”, set between 1940 and 1985. It would be something like Maupassant’s “A Life” and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself, in History, a “total novel” that would end with her dispossession of people and things”   Had she but of known the MBI jury were not fussed at the fiction/non-fiction distinction, I feel the author could have been spared years of agony.  This is clearly a book which is aimed at French readers, for whom the extensive cultural observations will make more or less sense depending on their age and interests – for an English reader much of it is obscure and, particularly where there were paragraphs of lists, I simply found myself skipping through large chunks with only at best cursory interest.  And this is not helped by the very odd footnotes. The translator has chosen to provide 29 brief footnotes (when either nil or 100+ or indeed a full appendix would have made more sense) – and I was puzzled by the choices made.  For example why in the sentence: “The table buzzed with peacefully disparate and mocking remarks, about the barbouzes, Mauriac and his stifled cluck of a laugh, the tics of Malraux” is only “barbouzes” footnoted – I can Google that just (if not more) easily than the two names.  This seems to reach a nadir with the decision, among copious untranslated French to footnote the French part of: “Kids requested fruit-flavoured Evain Water (‘l’Evian fruit, c’est plus muscle’)” with the translation as “Fruit flavoured Evain water makes you stronger”, whereas “Comme un arbre dans la Ville” on the same page is completely unfootnoted despite the first having both rather heavy explanatory context and words which are fairly easy to translate even for someone with zero French. In fact I cannot conceive of a reader who could translate the second but not the first.  Only to be exceeded when I was similarly baffled at one of the very limited English translator footnotes being given over to a translation from Spanish (“Giants and Cabzeudos”) which would presumably be just as required by a French reader?  Now I have to be honest the above criticisms are potentially unfair:  There is lots to like in this innovative piece of autofiction, particularly: the way the personal is turned into a collective, the clever way that pictures are used to capture and then anchor the passing of time and the mirroring of physical changes in inner and societal changes; the way political events form a backdrop and media/consumer changes form more of the foreground – reflecting the reality of most people’s actual experiences – so a form of socio-economic rather than political/economic history.  Many of the cultural references were either very interesting to me (for example the constant references to both World Wars from earlier generations, the view of 1968 as a lost opportunity or betrayal), personally familiar (Tour de France references), generally familiar to most English readers (much of French politics) or clear enough that I could grasp the social essence that was being described (and quickly draw an English analogy).  The footnotes while not perfect are useful while not being intrusive.  But the book completely forfeited my good will and sympathy with a shameful joke on the first page – whose inclusion I find entirely unjustifiable and which has cost the book its rating.","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer"
"I had no prior awareness of Annie Ernaux prior to reading The Years. It took me about fifty pages to find any reading rhythm and then.. bam! I found myself carried along with the prose. Really, really enjoyable. Ernaux writes in a particular style that’s not to everyone’s taste, and which has generated debate about the boundary between true fiction and thinly veiled autobiography. The translator Alison Strayer adds a postscript to discuss the Ernaux writing style concept and the author herself reflects on a kind of alter ego when she writes, there is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”.(229)  Although I am British, I had no problem imaging myself as part of the “we” of Ernaux’s French generation.  In particular I really enjoyed the historical backdrop. I am twenty years younger than Annie Ernaux, but the events that provide the framework for her world and life are immediately recognisable. * The recurring presence and issues surrounding the Algerian Independence movement evokes memories of the N. Ireland “Troubles”. *Some high profile people were (understandably) unknown to me, and very interesting-Gabrielle Russier is mentioned a few times, and her tragic story is especially striking given the similarities (with different outcome) for Brigitte Auziere. France’s current leading lady. * The seminal student movement of 1968. Evocative of American student protest, and of agenda setting, but a movement that never took hold in the UK. *There’s also the development of the banlieues and the emergence of the Le Pen far right. In 1989 Prime Minister Michel Rocard stated “France cannot take on all the misery of the world”  As a Briton I always viewed the French as cool, sophisticated, (and puzzling). The Years conveyed this sense of hedonism certainly before the millennium and the arrival of computers and then the Internet.  I like historical fiction, so I liked The Years. Not a perfect read but a stimulating one.  ***************************** I had the chance to see and hear Annie Ernaux at a rare literature event at Charleston, Sussex on 29.05.2023.

"Her style is cold and somewhat impersonal. As she takes us from the years following WWII to contemporary France, she doesn't put herself at the forefront. She lets her impressions of photos and memories tell the stories instead.  It's like looking at things underwater, both close and far away from understanding the hidden meanings.  An author whose work is subtle and often unforgettable in one way or another.","Mélie Nasr"
"Annie Ernaux's The Years is a beautiful book – wildly ambitious and at the same time quietly contemplative. While on one level it functions as a memoir, Ernaux uses the collective "we" rather than the expected "I". She takes the genre with its promises of truth gleaned from experience and uses it to interrogate psychic and social responses to modernity. Unlike a traditional memoir, Ernaux is not interested in self analysis – the "self" of this book is always positioned in relation to a broader collective experience of and being in history. So rather than pure autofiction or biography, the book represents an attempt to trace the contours of an evolving collective consciousness, one becoming increasingly fragmented and elusive.  While reading this I was continually amazed by Ernaux's precision in dealing with such slippery material. This is a very French book, and one heavily rooted in the specifics of French culture and politics, but I frequently felt myself and the people around me included in Ernaux's "we". It wouldn't be right to call it universal – the book is way too class conscious for that. But by going beyond the possibilities allowed for by memoir, The Years gets at something deeper about how our experience of time has changed with the acceleration of capitalism. Highly recommended.","sean"

"I read this due to it being on the Manbooker Longlist and vowed I'd treat myself if it made it to the Shortlist - it did. I have the highest of hopes for it to win.  I have not the words to describe the beauty and Humanity held within these pages, will younger readers recognise and be captivated re-living the memories that this volume evokes? I know not - I hope so, as I myself was born of the generation after the Author, and it all feels so very familiar - so much so that I told Husband if I ever have Dementia or Alzheimers please get me to read this, as my own past flashed before my eyes alarmingly often.  I cannot wait to read more of Annie Ernaux works - you can see where Birthday vouchers will be spent.  In closing this work has one of the most beautiful closing phrases - which I choose to leave you with, to tempt you to see where it came from.  " To save something from the time where we will never be again".","DJ"

"Annie Ernaux's book belongs in that odd genre of auto-fiction, books that are based on the author's own life, but the events of the past have either been altered or the author concedes that their own memories are not necessarily accurate. Here, Ernaux takes her own life and memories as a way of telling the story of what life was like during her life, for herself, for women in France, and for France itself.  Beginning in the mid-1940s, the book begins with Ernaux's earliest memories, and with descriptions of family photos of herself. As her story moves forward, it becomes a universal story of a time and place, of what family dinners looked like, what school was like and how things changed over time, with lifestyles adapting to the availability of consumer goods, as the older folks died and so the Sunday dinner conversations moved on from the war to other subjects, like the events in Algeria or student uprisings.  This is a superbly constructed and immensely readable book. I did stop many times to look up names and events, but that was due to my lack of knowledge of French history and popular culture. It was so interesting to look at a time slightly different from my own (Ernaux belongs to my parents' generation) and at a country other than my own. Ernaux mixes the personal with the universal as she writes her way through the years of her life and the result is something greater than either a straight memoir or social history would have been.","Alison Hardtmann"
"This is a very hard book to rate and to see as fiction. The author was born 5 years before me, while WW II was raging in France and has always lived in France. I was born at the end of the War in the US, yet our experiences of political events and their importance is very similar. Sometimes I was mesmerized; her recognition and labeling of the increasing commodification of life was fascinating. Sometimes I felt I was just reading lists and at others that I was at her Christmas dinner with her sons and their girlfriends. At the very end, I just felt like crying. And felt like reading her other books.","Susan"
""that this writing... is able to ...capture the reflections that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory" Annie Ernaux from the book.  I liked this very much - it often reminded me of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet - which I love. The book is designed to carry us through time from mid -WWII to 2006. How did people behave around a communal table, how did one relate to music and song, to one's own body, to the family, to political life? Auto-fiction --- sociological creative memoir - I don't know what to call it. The book often moves from the impersonal march of fads, history, advertising all jumbled together, back to the intensely personal relationship the narrator/exemplar human has to her own bodily functions - shit and blood reminding the reader that this is a real human body recording memories, storing information, and that all of that information will be lost if not ritually transmitted, and ultimately will all be lost indeed.  It could have used better footnotes.","Karen Witzler"
"Though I did not love this book, I can see how someone would (especially the French, as there is A LOT of French political history in here).  This books is a "generational" memoir, for lack of a better term. Ernaux has written a memoir that is told through her eyes, experiencing life as a member of a generation. The entire generation experienced the same school types, media, events, politicians, changing laws, changing sexual morés, etc. It begins with the description of a baby in a photo c1941 (herself) and continues into the 21st century. It is fully linear, discussing daily life, dreams, politics, family, work (she was a teacher), relationships, immigration, and so on.  Early on she examines the world her grandparents discuss at the table, the world her generation never knew, of dirt floors in houses and washing clothes in wood-ash (p25), and of the provincialness of different areas of France: their habits, food (p33), voices, "a mangled French mixed with local dialects" (p27), the following the Catholic calendar and sexual morés, and living in the scarcity of everything (p34). And how, for her generation, the school calendar replaced that of the season (p29).  My favorite bits revolved around the consumerism. First it was exciting, as "the days of restrictions were at an end" (p37). "We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-soled shoes, gold watches" (p39)--while they lived without indoor plumbing, enitre families sleeping in one room, with mustard poultices a common medicine. p 110: "And we who were undeceived, who seriously examined the dangers of advertising with our students; we who assigned the topic "Does the possession of material goods lead to happiness?" nought a stereo, a Grundig radio-cassette player, and a Bell & Howell Super 8 camera, with a sense of using modernity to intelligent ends. For us and by us, consumption was purified." This continues, right up to computers and cell phones. She is as nervous about a cellphone as her parents' generation was about computers. Which brings up aging, and how it sneaks up on you. "For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations" (p129) "She pictures herself in ten or fifteen years...for grandchildren not yet born. BUt she sees that woman as improbable, just as the girl of 25 saw the woman of forty, who she has become and already ceased to be" (p169).  There are two quotes at the very beginning of the book--facing the copyright page. On by José Ortega, the other by Chekhov. Part of the Chekhov quote: "And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful...". That is pretty much what this book is about.","Dree"
"Annie Ernaux’s The Years (“Les années” in its french original) is a sprawling and ambitious book that revisits one woman’s life and memories (the author’s) from the year she was born, 1940, to 2006 (fortunately not the time of her death but the year when she was finally able to write the book that was on the making for more than 30 years).  While the span of the book is very impressive, what makes it ambitions isn’t so much the ‘memoir’ part of it -- Ernaux wasn’t interested in writing about her life, plain and simple: she wanted to interweave political, cultural and technological change with the memories of her own past; a decision that, after reading the book, seems almost paramount, as if everything that happened to this woman was directly influenced by the passage of time and the changes in society -- and, of course, it was… the span of Ernaux’s life is impressive and she lived (lives) in a time that is constantly changing, from the end of the second world war to the technological boom of the late twentieth century.  But then again, that’s not what makes this memoir especial, either. Ernaux is interested in writing from a ‘collective’ point of view -- The Years is an “impersonal autobiography” where there’s no place for “I”. Indeed, everything is narrated in “we” (and, when things get a bit more personal, like when the narrator is describing personal photographs, “she”), a collective voice, as if everything Ernaux experienced was universal to her generation (credited as the “Silent Generation”), particularly if you are a leftist woman. Ernaux wants to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.”  When said like that, The Years and Ernaux intentions seem futile, almost narcissistic -- how is it possible that a generation can share so much? “To think of oneself in collective terms brought a certain exaltation.” But when I read it, what I found most striking was just how likely that actually is (of course, there will always be personal differences and stories, influenced by none other than our own upbringing and circumstance) and, even more striking, how some of what she is narrating is indeed, even if embedded in french history and politics (much of which went over my head), transversal, collective to not only persons of the female gender from her generation, but the human condition.  If anything, it served to confirm the idea that humans don’t really change and history will, in some way or the other, repeat itself. “Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except perhaps in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, ‘So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.’”  and  “We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.” The passages of the confrontation between generations was particularly true to me and made me laugh/smile with a bittersweet feeling. Every generation has a hard time understanding and accepting the newer ones, if not for subconscious reasons like that of being ‘cast aside’ and ‘overcome’, then because we live in a society that is constantly changing and what matters to a certain generation is simply ‘history’ to another, felt with a rubber plasticity of ‘foreign’ and ‘distant’. “The times, people said, are not the same for everyone.”  and  “Adults suspected us of being corrupted by modern writers and of having no respect for anything.”  and  “In opposition to the desires that made us restless, we were served the wisdom of limits: ‘You ask too much of life.’” There are other reflections that aren’t as universal to every human but nonetheless painfully true to women’s lives. Like the ‘generational problem’, reading about issues that were happening in the 50s/60s, regarding women’s right to choose and the role of female caretaker, and how much, at the same time, everything and nothing changed, I’m left again with a bitter (nothing sweet about it) feeling in my mouth. “The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.”   And that’s why I think The Years is, even after ten years since it was first published and more than forty since some of the described events, still so unfortunately relevant today and a source of great introspection about the passage of time, memory and identity.","Maddie"
"Somber story set in Paris between 1941 and the present telling the story of a woman, her family and events in her life during this time frame. The story could just as easily been titled “The Life Cycle.”  There are no chapters and there is no dialogue. There is no humor whatsoever. Not exactly an uplifting read. However, the story is well-crafted and deserving of being short-listed for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. The reader gets a real sense of the various time periods and society.","Larry Davidson"
"Superb and highly original.  Besides being a pretty marvellous meditation on ageing and memory, this is such a simple (ha) and utterly sensible idea. Namely, that you are a product of your time, so what better way to write about a life than to retell it, overwhelmingly (but not exclusively), through the events and conventions of the age you lived through. It's so obvious that I can't believe it isn't seen more in fiction. And yes, that question: is it fiction (yes, surely). I love it how French lit keeps pushing the boundaries like this.  It's all rather moving and it's hard not to feel quite powerful empathy for the subject (I'd compare it a bit to 'The Up Series'). I for one found myself - dare I say it - feeling greater understanding of the Boomer generation (though actually these guys are older - they're more like Wartime Generation,,,though they were young in '68 too) and the cultural turns they experienced. By which I mean: growing up in a world where you had to get married to have sex and wearing lipstick was seen as whore-like...to letting your offspring have their their girlfriend stay over. No wonder they were a bit confused and contorted.  As the years a pass, ones own memories come into view...which, in a way, adds to the interest. I'm not sure if this is Annie Ernaux's 'method', but it's very readable and makes for a kind of literary documentary. A sort of : this is what we were like. The only example in English of that voice I can remember is 'And Then We Came to the End' dealing in an entirely different realm. It works extremely well. As an observer of Francophonie and France in a permanent state of trying to catch up and fill in gaps, it's almost prefect reading for me. I hope the English version does well.  Oh by the way: the name of the pub in Finchley is the 'Tally Ho Corner'. I had to Google 'Telly O'Corner' to check if this was something she'd dreamed. It's a sweet example of bad-memory Chinese Whispers. Bravo.        ","Jake Goretzki"
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represenr the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone with the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust. Even more than this book, the future is the next man who will make her dream, buy new clothes, and wait for a letter, a phone call, a message on the answering machine." (p.169-170)  Annie Ernaux wants to write a 'we', but looking at photographs of herself (taken in different times of her life) she doesn't come any further than 'she'. As a reader much younger than Ernaux I recognise a lot of the happenings and hypes she writes about and refers to (at times I even want to correct details in her timeline), but nowhere I felt to be part of the 'we' Ernaux is trying to create. While reading I felt something missing. I became to realise that while Ernaux was searching a 'we', I was looking for an 'I'.","Bert"
"I was in a bookshop in Cork city and chatting with one of the managers I know and I asked if anything of worth had actually been published in the last year. He said not really except for one thing. That ended up being this book. He told me to read the first page, which I did, and I was immediately sold.  Ernaux's style of memoir-as-social-history is such an enjoyable form of writing. It reminded me of reading Alexievich for the first time, that discovery of a whole new mode of storytelling. The whole book is such an immersive evocation of French life, rarely have I read a memoir that so engrains the reader into its world.  What a stunning work.","Barry Pierce"
"Known in Australia as The Years, this is an enlightening read about times I have lived through myself. Anne Ernaux lives in France. She was born in 1941, and her memoirs cover the period from the immediate post war years up to 2008. The highly regarded author of two novels, she was working on writing this work for many years. It's structured around seminal photos of her, as described in print. Her diary notes, thoughts, quotes from her reading also form the basis of the memoir. Her writing illustrates the lucidity and discipline of form resulting from the French education system where ideas must be explored logically from more than one angle and conclusions clearly established. Ernaux wants to go further, she's fascinated by how memory and time are major forces shaping our identities. Poignantly, she reminds us how when a person dies, all their memories and experiences are ended. The result is a fascinating record of life in France 1945-2008. It's both very personal and all-encompassing of French society. Her expression has elements of stream of consciousness, if you can imagine that combined with a constant flow of precise details. Judging by the translator's notes, Alison L Strayer is to be congratulated for her work in this valuable and entertaining book.","Anne Fenn"

I can imagine that every audio version of this book could it make easier to get into the style of it and into the memories predominantly based on European and French events and the society Ernaux lived and lives in. If you understand the tone of some things mentioned, it is not obligatory that you know every detailed background.  #ReadingWomenMonth #InTranslation","Amelia"
"I loved this. A semi-autobiographical social memoir; it contains personal moments but is as much a story of the author’s generation and the changing times. From the post-war austerities where she grew up, the growth of consumerism, the revolutions ‘68 and the seventies, the economic rationalism of the eighties, the changes in attitudes, consumer goods, politics and lived experiences are deftly detailed and beautifully expressed. I don’t mean to make this sound like a bland non-fiction surface tale of the times. Ernaux’ prose is beautiful and poetic, her social history dotted with personal moments and impressionistic images and interior thoughts. I’m not of the author’s generation, but I’ve lived through perhaps enough of the same times to be able to relate to a lot of it, and I found it powerful and moving.","Ben Payne"
"An autobiography of the unnamed narrator, as well as a biography of the post-WWII era in which she grew up, this book is interesting meld of social and personal history that emotionally connects with the reader. It helps if you have more than a passing knowledge of 20th century French history, however, as you'll otherwise be rather lost, even with the footnotes.","Ann Olszewski"
"This was a truly remarkable book. It goes beyond autobiography in that Ernaux draws on history to show how lives are influenced by politics and the cultural milieu, in this case being a woman living in France from 1941-2006. I found it stunning and would reread it again without hesitation. It's a work of genius, verging on a miraculous achievement.","Elaine"

""So her book's form can only emerge from her complete immersion in the images from her memory in order to identify, with relative certainty, the specific signs of the times, the years to which the images belong, gradually linking them to others; to try to hear the words people spoke, what they said about events and things, skim it off the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we are and what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope." (p228)  This is not exactly a memoir and not exactly a novel, nor a biography, nor anything else to speak of. It moves shiftily through time and images, memories and politics. It combines them into a sketch of a person whom you see in the background, or off center as in a photograph, never directly looking you in the eye. This was also not for me. I'm not sixty six years old or French and can't connect with ninety percent of the political occurences memories in this book. But the personal feelings attached to it are universal. I found the fact that it was so foreign and yet so familiar strangely comforting.","Matt"

"This an amazing accomplishment, but I am not sure how easy it would be to read for someone who doesn't have any knowledge of French history or popular culture. I read it in French and I get most of it but not all, since the writer is older than me and some things she mentions would have happened or existed way before my time. I haven't seen the translation but anyone who translated this would have to have extensive knowledge of both language and culture. Annie Ernaux links the collective memory and the individual memory and succeeds in painting a social history through objects, language and especially through the evocation of feelings. It is beautifully written and the lyrical language evokes a France that has changed profoundly in the last seventy years. If you are at home in French societal culture you have to read it. It could be frustrating if you are not.","Cathy Beyers"
"I loved this book, to the extent that I am having trouble writing about it coherently. It is moving and glorious. The way she immerses her particular individual experience into collective experience works so beautifully. She grew up in a different country to me (obviously) but at many points I identified acutely with her experience. I was left with a sharp sense of how transitory language and historical experience are, and yet also with a sense of how much the particularities of everyday life and political events are worth preserving.","Chimene Bateman"
"One of my reads for women in translation month. I bought this book (the german translation) in Bolzano, Italy while I was on vacation; with no intention to start this until I got home. But I was drawn to it instantly. I always had a weird connection to France; I took 8 years of french in school (but still manage to suck at it), but I know weirdly little of its history when it has no connection to Germany (sorry for that).  As someone born in 1999 I can only vaguely imagine living in a post-war time. It is not something I can relate to. Ernaux manages to describe the life in France beautifully, while always keeping herself (semi-)distant from her own young self and more connected to what life was like for a generation, what society felt like. The 3rd Person narrative only adds to that. There are anecdotes you know have to be more personal to her and others that can be applied more generally. She really suceeds with conveying how people, how life changed; and in telling you all the ways in which they don't, in how youth never really changes, or growing older never does.  The closer she comes to the present, the older she gets, the more she talks about politics and looks back on life. While these were still good parts, I did not enjoy them as much as did the rest. Maybe when I grow older, I will understand them better or appreciate them more.  I will definitely pick up other books by Ernaux in the future. And maybe when I feel the need to brush up my french, I will pick up this book in french and read it as it was intented.","Maren"
"I picked this up because it made the International Booker Prize Shortlist. I think I may have found a new favorite writer. My tastes of the past 2 years have leaned heavily towards women writers in translation and Ernaux was a great discovery in my quest to read writers not writing in English.  This was such a creative way to capture a life, almost like a film - moving images cast across the pages. Her writing is efficient and engaging at once. I found myself jotting down the many French cultural and historical references to explore further. In this sense her writing reminded me of Patti Smith’s - each possessing the ability to convey their worlds through snapshots set up against a time and place and the movements that defined them.  Highly recommended for those with “...a penchant for everything that makes one dream, books, music, films.” (P 224)","Jenn C."
"I should first explain that Annie Ernaux is my exact contemporary: I too, was born in 1941. Also, Annie’s tale interests me because — even though I have spent most of my life in the US — my mother grew up in France, was born not far from Yvetot, and I myself spent 2 years of my early childhood in France. So Annie’s marvelous account of what it was like to live through all the first 70 years of her life resonates with me, bringing up many cherished memories, while at the same time finding it fascinating because I learn many things I had not understood before. There is no plot. Rather each episode, to call it that, is like a still view of a particular time in the life of this unnamed woman (all told in the third person) first as a child, then a teenager, then an unmarried and suddenly married woman with a husband and 2 children, then a divorcée with children, then in an empty house but still working, and finally as a single retired person. It is so personal, so intimate, so much so that the notice at the beginning of the book, which tells the reader that the author lived in the locations described in the tale, is entirely superfluous. Just like a painter that assembles her still life by a sequence of paint strokes, Annie does it by an assembly of details of what people, including herself, wear, do, and feel at the moment the snapshot is taken, including not only what is immediately at hand, but what is happening in the world around them. Often these “still views” start with the detailed description of a family picture that has her in among those pictured. The pictures come to life because she not only tells us in great detail what people wear in those pictures (which of course reflects the clothes of the day for persons that age) but also the way that the individual wears them, I.e. the posture and “the look.” But along with the sartorial and other details of family line Annie also describes the politics of the day, the hopes and fears associated with each presidential election in France, the large societal changes that followed the post-war day and led France into the 21st century, the advent of consumerism, the increasing irrelevance of not unassailable authorities in her youth, namely the Catholic religion and the prominent lay philosophers of the day, and the gradual change from the locally-bound village life in which she was born, moving on to the broadening of her horizons in university in Paris, passing on then to middle class life in a modern (and typically antiseptic) Paris suburb, to then move on to a more rural environment, but now enveloped by today’s web of mass instant communication. I have not come across any other book that so neatly communicates how much has changed in the life of an ordinary person during the past 80 years, not only because society has changed, but because — as we get older — our priorities change and we relate differently to those around us.","Raul"
"Hard to classify: is it a novel? an essay? a history book? Whatever it is it’s rather curious. No self, only us. Our collective biography. The ‘one’ is impersonal, referred to as ‘she’ (as if seen from the outside, divorced from her inner self). This works well. Devoid of self, speaking in the name of the impersonal collective, all the stereotypes are in the open. This is freedom: no risk of being accused.  However, the lack of storyline is disturbing, one could not connect to the narrator, except there is no one to connect to - it is ‘our’ biography, remember? If ‘we’ were French, born in the 50s, perhaps, it would touch us at a deeper level.  On the other hand, haven’t we dreamed of the History of the little man? No Napoleons, no warfare, no political treaties. How the little man got by through the years. No story: just one thing after the other.","Sorin Hadârcă"
"This book stunned me and scared the shit out of me and made me feel both very alone and wholly embraced. I could make a lot out of the way Ernaux’s examination of collective memory, history, and time and place upends all manner of supposed dichotomies (and already have, to the probable annoyance of my loved ones), but it seems most appropriate to note that I believe I read this at the exact right moment. That I feel this way at 25, about a book spanning over 60 years of life (for a particular French generation!) and deeply concerned with remembrance and even aging, should tell you all you need to know about Ernaux’s skills as a writer and chronicler of shared experience. Her specificity produces a sort of universality and vice versa; you are left feeling as if you know Ernaux very well and not at all, and as if that is and is not the point.","Meredith"
"This book easily goes back and forth between the author's life experience ('she') and of the general experience of the French public ('we') during the author's life. It got a bit tedious when she talked about the timeframe between the Berlin wall coming down and 9/11 and but aside from that I found this 'dreamscape' autobiographical fiction fascinating, especially when it was frank about the French public's past/present racist feelings about SWANA immigrants and the author's then-illegal abortion.","Crystal"

"Annie Ernaux’s Man Booker International shortlisted book, The Years, is a cumulative history of one person and an entire nation ranging from 1940 (when the writer is born) to 2006 (when the book comes to fruition). The Years defies convention and escapes the straitjacketing that simplistic genre categories entail. In writing her memoir, Ernaux weaves together her own life with that of the nation she has come to know so intimately through a collage of memoires, culture, songs, news headlines, photographs, and paintings. In voicing her hopes and disappointments, she pens down the turbulent history of France, its many failings and numerous gifts.  Ernaux writes as “we,” occasionally pointing the narrative towards herself, referring to herself as “she” when she describes certain snapshots of herself, which have a small inscription regarding the setting in which they were taken. These moments are interspersed throughout the narrative to foreground the fact that Ernaux is still talking about her life, even though the larger focus is always on France and the French.  I went into the book expecting to read about the life of a brilliant French writer and I came out with my head spinning with intricate details, mesmerized by how much a memoir could reveal not just about a person, but their context, their environment, their history, which is also the history of an entire generation that breathes with them, their struggles, which are invariably the struggles of an entire population that lives through that time.  Ernaux is unapologetic when she criticizes France for its willed amnesia—its role in the Jewish genocide, the aftermath of the two Wars that lasted a long time—and its less than glorious past. The leash on female sexual agency and its subsequent liberation brought upon by the invention of the pill, the rapid transformation into a consumerist economy and the spirited use of technology which would signal the beginning of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning are all written about with candour. The Years is thus rightly hailed as a collective autobiography that is both personal and public, both specific and universal, a book for our times and for all times. I can’t thank Alison L. Strayer enough for translating this literary marvel flawlessly into English. ","Vanya"

"DNF around 45% I loved the way she told her story using third person narration but the story itself didn’t interest me. In large part because there were so many social, political, cultural references that I didn’t understand. Wasn’t worth finishing for me.","Jennie Chantal"
"Gosh I found this very difficult to get into. I really liked the concept , particularly appreciated the reflections on ageing and insight into French history/society - but ultimately I think too many of the cultural references were totally alien to me, with very little explained via the footnotes. id be googling so many times in each page to fully understand the meaning, and even then couldn’t really understand it in the way a French person or a French scholar could, I don’t think. In the end I just let the general feeling and ideas wash over me, rather than trying to look up each individual reference I didn’t know. I can see it’s a beautifully written and thought out book, just not possible for me to fully get into it as I’d have hoped to Edited to say - another book making use of this concept is Juliet Gardner ‘joining the dots’ - similar way of locating personal history in wider social and political landscape, but mainly British (English) cultural markers, also worth a read","Vicky"

"This is an autobiography which aims to avoid “sentiment”: “The point is not to speak of the personal”. Instead, referring to herself in the third person, or writing collectively as “we”, Annie Ernaux adopts a fragmented approach which tends to distance the reader from her.  As implied by the choice of quotations at the outset, she is preoccupied with our insignificance in the scale of things – not only shall we be forgotten as individuals, but matters of great importance to us will seem trivial to our descendants, and our way of living may come to seem ludicrous, even blameworthy. This has become very topical since our materialist way of life, justified by “the need for growth” is now under criticism for destroying the planet for future generations.  Annie Ernaux’s attitude may explain her tendency to give more importance to fleeting, often banal memories than to major events in her life. The opening pages are a list of ephemeral images, some from before she was born, reflecting her insight that, influenced by our parents’ talk, we may have a kind of false memory of events which happened to other people in the past before we even existed. Many of the images are sordid or grim, and it would seem quite arbitrary – a woman urinating behind a café, the glimpse of a thalidomide victim with no arms. This sets from the outset a somewhat depressing, negative, joyless tone which is never fully dispelled.  She often seems more interested in the social history through which she has lived than in recounting the main events of her life. So, on one hand she writes a good deal about the impact of the 1968 riots, the social revolution resulting from the availability of the pill or the arrival of a consumer- driven society which also discarded the taboos and traditions which constrained our childhood until the 1960s. On the other, I never learned, for instance, whom she married, nor when and how the couple parted. She makes no allowance for the reader’s frustration if significant details are hinted at but kept hidden. She writes about a woman’s desire for divorce, mixed with fear of rupture and independence, in an abstract, generalised way. In just one poignant scene, which reveals complex feelings during what may be the last family holiday with her husband in Spain, she becomes an individual with whom one can sympathise, suggesting that a little more “sentiment” in the book would not have gone amiss.  I formed the impression of a bright girl from a narrow, working class background, who “escaped” via the encouragement of her teachers and a good education. However, breaking the taboos over sex outside marriage just a few years ahead of “the pill” and loosening of the abortion laws, she joined the ranks of those obliged to marry and start a family before they would have chosen to do so. She seemed dissatisfied with her lot as a teacher, perhaps because of her long-held desire to be a writer. Drawn to left-wing movements, uneasy over consumerism and the faceless development of new urban areas, Annie Ernaux nevertheless comes across as an “academic” socialist, actually rather contemptuous of workers in the unappealing new suburbs built for them, where she would never willingly set foot.  It is not her style to discuss explicitly her frustration over being diverted by family responsibilities from achieving the ambition to become an admired author. Instead, it is revealed when, oppressed by the annual ritual of the Christmas celebrations in which she now occupies the head of the table, she imagines the crazed action of overturning the table and screaming. Perhaps because she is a writer, a recurring theme is her panicked sense of only having one life, which she has allowed to slip by, without realising it: the living of her past life amounts to a book, but one that has not yet been written - until now.  I found the book hard-going at times. The repetition and lists of people and events are quite tedious and I was not familiar with many of the cultural references. It was fascinating to learn about, say, Ranucci, the last French citizen to be sentenced to death as recently as 1976 by guillotine, which seemed particularly barbaric and antiquated although it was originally seen as more humane than other methods, but the need to look things up continually fragmented the reading of an already disjointed text which rambles on for over two hundred and fifty pages in short sections with no chapters to form natural breaks.  Annie Ernaux has said: “This is the story of events and progress and everything that has changed in 60 years of an individual existence but transmitted through the “we” and “them”. The events in my book belong to everyone, to history, to sociology”.  Yet this approach only works if the events are clearly explained in context to those who did not experience them at the time, and may be ignorant of them now. Admittedly, those who can share her experiences may derive a nostalgic pleasure from being reminded of them.","Antenna"
"Fantastic autobiographical sociological historical novel spanning the time 1940-2006. Extraordinary well translates into German by Sonja Finck.","Lorens"
"A great impersonal autobiography of the exploration of memory, time, and photography. Ernaux has covered 70 years of her life using photographs of herself as basis to discuss collective memories of social-political climate of an ever-changing France with its ideologies and its responses to the world's events while personal/individual life suffers from the waves from a decade to another, to a year to another, and to events to another. A really powerful, rich, and well-written autobiography.","Sandra Miksa"
"Enraux's memoir is personal but also and primarily collective - she believes that family narrative is one and the same as social narrative. And so bits of her life (she is she or her or one, never I, indeed she eschews that personal pronoun) from photos when she is a baby and as she grows up, are set within the framework of historical and political events in France. Some of the references eluded me as a non-French person, and some of the references fit in with her other works that I've read - about having an abortion when she was a college student when it was illegal, her marriage and divorce, falling in love with a Russian, falling in love with a younger man - and are given only a little bit of space here. I gleaned a little additional knowledge about her, but don't feel that I "know" her as I have felt I've come to know others by reading their memoirs, and that seems to have been her intent - that how a single person is affected by events is perhaps not as important as how many are affected. And the form she chose to write her memoir emphasizes that and provides a fascinating overview of French life over time.","Cherise Wolas"
"I feel so pleased when a novel I am resisting and condemning finally wins me over and makes me a fan, and that is exactly what happened with The Years. Ernaux's novel could be considered autofictional memoir but she narrates the novel using the plural "we," rather than the singular "I," writing as a voice of her generation growing up in France and stressing, shared rather than individual experiences. This is why I lost interest early. The novel referenced numerous cultural memes that held no significance for me and I grew tired of googling lines to period song lyrics or cultural fads. The novel began early post WWIi and those references were before my time. By the time she writes of the Fifties and Sixties most of the references were familiar to me and I was able to enjoy the novel more. Oddly enough, from Nineties onto the present I started feeling lost again, having to research references. This is because the novel mirrored my knowledge of French cultural history. I was ignorant of matters from before I was born or as a young child, and became more versed during the years I spent in school and for a decade or so after, and then saw my cultural literacy decrease as I aged and became more occupied with family and work rather than global issues. The book gets five stars alone for acting as that mirror. But further Ernaux provides a perspective on the homogenization of culture and the consequential role of the United States on world culture in this book which I found educating. I thank Annie Ernaux for this book. How come it wasn't picked for the Man Booker International Prize is a whole other discussion, but it has been my favorite of those selected to compete.","Sam"
"A fascinating personal and generational memoir though it's more than just a conventional memoir as it defies precise genre pigeonholing. The book narrates the cultural and political history of postwar France blended with the author's autobiographical reminiscences (written in the third person). The collective history is reflected in her personal life but Ernaux also seems to use her own personal story to flesh out the main currents through several decades in French society. The themes range from the evolving position of women, left-right politics, consumerism, colonial oppressions and wars, changing popular cultural tastes in music, films, fashion... an amazing assortment of themes rendered in a uniquely crafted novelistic style.  I think the essence of this unique book is best described in Ernaux's own words in this passage: “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.” And she accomplished it most brilliantly.","Vesna (on hiatus)"
"Annie Ernaux has now long been hailed as one of the most critical chroniclers of French life and yet it has taken me up until now to read one of her novels. ‘Les Années’ is a memoir like no other, where the ‘me’ is replaced by a communal ‘we’ spanning the author’s birth in 1940 up to 2006. Raised in a traditional working-class roman Catholic family in Normandy, each vignette in the book is similar to opening up a treasure box, full of old family photo albums, where the author uses her life to chart societal upheavals by invoking key cultural and technological innovations. More than anything, this is a sociological history of France that slowly leaps out of each page via the collapse of Catholic primness as it’s attacked by secularism, the pill or the legalisation of abortion. This memoir is an earnest and necessary book. Such a fantastic find, I just simply cannot wait to read all her other books","Morgan Miller-Portales"
"Beautifully written, I loved Ernaux’s prose and found I simply couldn’t put it down. At times, though maybe this comparison is a bit irreverent, I felt I was reading as the narrator in A Christmas Story, breathlessly working my way through the events of her life, smiling along the way. I was reminded of Kundera’s clean writing (though it’s been years since I’ve read any), perhaps owing to the parallels with, and mentions of, the Prague Spring. Just wonderful.","nelan"
"Goodreads doesn't have the English-language translation of this book—The Years—as an option that can be selected. But it is available in English and definitely worth the read. Experimental in that it tells not an individual's story but a collective one, The Years is a memoir of five decades of life in French society. I think often that memoirs lack context, and it was thrilling to read one that is essentially ALL context.","Marin"
"A beautiful and masterfully crafted review of a life. With phototographs prompting her, Ernaux writes the experience of living in France — from her birth in the 1940s, all the way up to 2006. In her skimming of the years, which hurtle past the reader dizzyingly, she speaks of the feminist struggle, the rise of French nationalism, the decline of the left, the seduction of a nostalgie de la boue, May 1968, 1981, terrorism, violence, poverty, Y2K, the internet — all these historical landmarks experienced by the ‘je-collectif’. Within these blocks burgeons a life, ambition, marriage and divorce, childhood and motherhood, anomie and amorousness. Ernaux writes with delicious detail, an intelligent eye, and a rendering so vivid, it often feels like a gut punch. She does not shy away from shame, from desire, from grief. An important memoir, highly recommended.","Davinia"
"Find a photograph of yourself as a child. Scrutinise its details: your clothes, your hair, the background. Draw out the memory of that time. Let the memory take hold of you. Reflect on it, sentence by sentence. Stop writing only when the memory has been exhausted. Then, pick-up another photograph of yourself a few years later. Repeat the process. Do it again and again until you've left the past behind and have reached the present. This is the literary methodology behind French writer Annie Ernaux's Les Anées, a meticulously observed third-person narrative which sits somewhere between novel, memoir and autobiography, but in doing so also manages to read as an intergenerational personal/political epic of post-war France.  In this chapterless book, Ernaux (the book's impersonal "she") traces the story of her life through the transforming historical conditions of 'the years'. As the narrator puts it, right at the culmination of the book, "By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History." And what is this history? It's the hunger and fear of occupied France. It's the insurgencies of 68. It's the victory of neoliberalism and the Eurozone. It's becoming a generation of grandparents, playing Nintendo Wiii with grandkids. The Years is also a book that dramatises the writer-narrator's own journey towards conceiving and then writing the book itself: "There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography", Ernaux writes, developing the kinds of literary form and grammar that are needed for a work such as this. "There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before. ... It will be a slippery narrative, composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolutely, devouring the present as it goes." Honestly, this is an astonishing book. And it feels right, somehow, to be reading it in the final weeks of the general election, as we are –whatever the outcome– in a transitional moment of British life. I want to read it again already. It's the kind of book I'd have loved to read in its original language. But I have absolutely no grasp of French. So it goes.","Dominic"

"What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day.  "Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write "a kind of woman's destiny" set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself."","Adam Dalva"
"Memory's force reigns powerfully for Ernaux, and she wrests control back through an astonishing act of expansive record-keeping for her generation's thoughts, hopes, fears, and foibles. Further, Erneaux presents her case with blemishes and indelicacies relatively unvarnished. The word for this kind of a book must be "riveting": permanently fastened, driven through circular power (which is to say persistence), and strong enough to hold fast.","Leif"
"This is why one must keep a diary so that creation of a treasure like this over 30 years is possible, if you are a gifted writer. There are details of recent French politics which are difficult to follow, but her erudite way of explaining the gestalt of the society was truly enjoyable to me. ","Cigdem"
"What a wonderful idea to expand the story of your life to a larger collective and include a complete generation into it! Through the pages of this book, I saw life unfolding in France from Second World War all the way into the 9/11 paranoia. I read about a world moving towards collectivism as its youth embraced the ideas from Russia. And then isolate itself in the distraction of TV sets (and later even further into personal screens, but that was after Ernaux). Towards the end, the isolation becomes a paranoia after the towers fall as if those towers of capitalism were also the last icon for collectivism.  The Years uses a unique style of writing an autobiography. Even in the collectivism, there is a story which is deeply personal - about hopes and optimism, tamed heroism, a disappointment of passing years and then a comfort in self. Ernaux has picked a few photographs and a few family gatherings to showcase her life. In these scenes, we can witness her as an individual and as the person interacting with her tribe. Her descriptions lay out the scene in front of the eye (...her light brown shoulder-length hair is pulled back with a barrette. There is something ascetic or disenchanted in her expression. The smile comes too late to be spontaneous) The book was difficult to read, as I struggled through its 230 pages for more than three weeks. Part of the difficulty was the unusual structure, but I also felt that Ernaux had written the book for her own memory and was not concerned about drawing the reader’s interest. I found it hard to be engaged in the life of someone who was not talking to me but to herself. But there was always enough in her recollections to keep drawing me back. It triggered a few memories but it also prompted me to evaluate my generation’s changing beliefs over time, particularly on political ideology. That one thing alone was a great takeaway from this read.","Madhuri"

"6 Oct. 2022 update: Ernaux got the Nobel Prize for literature! No doubt in part for this truly original novel, which many consider her masterpiece. Do read it :-) I'm leaving the review below unchanged, as you can see I agree with the Swedish Academy for a change!  Well-written, original, stimulating.  This is an autobiography of Annie Ernaux. Sort of. Ernaux takes a step back, looks at herself as another, contemplates the world as it happened, and tells us about the years - from about 1945 to 2008 (Ernaux was born in 1940).  Initially, there's little room for individuality, and the book doesn't feel very much like a novel. Instead it's a list of experiences seen or heard, which happened not just to Ernaux, but to the various groups of people that included her or surrounded her: children, young women, people from the countryside, war veterans, etc.  This includes "historical events", for instance Mai 1968, Mitterrand elected president, the fall of the Berlin wall, 9/11... Societal changes: the contraceptive pill, the possibility of divorce, sexual liberation, consumer society, computers... All sorts of "trivial" things - things people used to say or do, things people sensed or felt or aspired to, communal events, popular jokes, advertising slogans...  As time passes, though, Ernaux is no longer fully embedded into that great marching crowd. The narrative is at times more personal: from the child of her time, she becomes the lover of successive men, the mother of her children, and the writer of this book. But even then she continues to observe the crowd making its way forward, leaving behind the elderly lady that she has become.  In some ways, I can't help but read this as the "biography" of an entire generation, that of my parents or grandparents (Ernaux is right in between). Then I want to judge these people, for the world they've given us, for being too caught up in their selfish desires (including political ones, which are much more selfish than Ernaux seems to realize), for not paying enough attention to the consequences of their decisions. But of course that's easy in hindsight; and besides, Ernaux's France is not theirs; this is not a treaty about French society, but the France experienced by a person. On the other hand, watching times change in the course of her life makes me realize with a new intensity that I'm also living through a succession of unique fleeting historical and social and personal moments. That there was never anything like being someone like me, here, at this point in time. That I will continue to go through these moments.  All in all, eye-opening, with a very beautiful passage near the end. The first 50 pages or so were a bit of a slog, costing it one star... even though it's hard to see how that could be avoided given what Annie Ernaux is trying to convey.  (If you're not French, look for an edition that has a copious amount of notes, otherwise many sentences just won't make sense, because they refer or nod to specifically French pieces of pop-culture.)","Tomq"
"This book, which launched the concept of “collective autobiography,” vacillates between two very distinct forms of narrative. The premise is that an unlikely pair of narratives can work together dialectically to construct a more complex self-portrait of the author. In one strand, Ernaux provides a history of post-war France as seen through her own subjective experiences and her very personal lens. These portions are written in first person plural, in ‘we.’ The second, alternating narrative is that of her own story as she grows up, except that Ernaux turns the ‘I’ of autobiography into the ‘she�� of biography. Ernaux treats the memories she has of herself as if they were the observations of another. The big themes for Ernaux are family, class, feminism, commercialism, and politics. Though when she writes about the collective history of her time, she speaks not for her entire generation but only for those her share her particular views. The Years is the story of her tribe. For a much longer review see my blog .","Terry Pitts"

"An incredible, generous take on the memoir as a genre. Ernaux makes her self the lens through which we come to know the world as it was and has been between 1940 and the late aughts. It's personal as well as a story of the people of France, culture writ large, and how much we change with time—and how much we don't.","Laura Linart"
" It’s hard to review or give an opinion on such perfection. I don’t have the words or the grace to be able to fully explain this extraordinary piece of writing.  All I can say is that it has been a wild, and yet introspective ride through the last 60-70 years of France’s history through the eyes and experiences of Annie Ernaux, the person, the writer, the mother, the lover, the WOMAN.  She provides insights not just into her life but into the very soul of a generation of women fighting for emancipation.  She never uses ‘I’, but ‘We’ to reflect upon her generation that transforms year after year. A real tour de force through a lifetime of experiences.  One more thing I wanted to add - the Translator’s note at the end. Alison Strayer’s note is unique to my experience but adds to the depth of my understanding of AE’s work. It was a great detail to add at the end.","Andreea"
"Elusive  What an impressive undertaking, to write an autobiography without ever using the first person pronoun, without succumbing to the tyranny of me, me, me, but to project oneself as a representative of a generation, a society, a product of circumstances and structures that applied to a whole cohort. I could see it, absolutely, for Annie Ernaux's early life. Born in 1940, she grew up in a monolithic society, yes, one structured by a shared set of values, essentially unchanged over generations. I wondered if this would continue into contemporary times, as the society she lives in becomes more atomised would her style of narration change? No, no. There is a real sense of a faster pace of change between generations, but essentially she still sees Western society as the late flowering of a capitalist concentration on persuading everyone that happiness lies in buying more stuff.  Elusive? Yes, because there are moments arranged across the flow of narrative which look at a photo, a shot of this girl, who becomes a woman, who is recognizable each time, but treated as an image, one to look at and wonder about. Distanced. Elusive.  Reference is made to this painting by Dorothea Tanning, Birthday. Ernaux says that's how she saw her life, doors open, choices to be made.... but that was never a sense I got, ever, that there were choices. Not individual choices, but a kind of socio-determinism. I have to say that I am puzzled. Maybe the image meant as a balance.  ","Karen·"

I do think it's a great book even if pages passed without making an impression. I would only recommend this to people who are interested in form- it completely accomplishes the goal of writing a personal memoir and general history without referring to oneself (using "me" or "I"). It reads more like long-form prose to me, like flipping through a scrapbook, which is a nice effect. But I don't recommend it if you're looking for a story. It is too fragmented and reliant on lists and cursory explanations to be a page turner. Interesting but not engaging.","Lucy Dacus"

"Structured like a scrapbook, The Years documents the history of France from the time of WWII to the late 2000s. Ernaux patiently examines the aging of the generation that grew up in the wake of the Liberation of Paris, alternating between detailing collective experience in the first-person plural and recounting her own daily life in the third-person singular. The work reads as a slow-moving collage of images, phrases, advertisements, artworks, private memories, and public events, plucked from time and carefully arranged into a continuous narrative. In detached, sometimes dreamy, prose the writer expertly captures the pace of social change, and demonstrates how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable, zigzag way.","Michael"
"A memoir unlike any memoir I've ever read.","Devin Kelly"
"Never have I read a book full of the mundane things of everyday life and yet been so interested. Annie Ernaux has the ability to take even the everyday common things of life and find the value in them, while also finding the silliness in things that in two generations will have no meaning. Her writing is raw and sometimes graphic.  To write an autobiography without using the term "I" takes writing prowess. It changes the whole narrative, as if one is looking into her life with her, detached; or perhaps really looking at the life of thousands of other French women of her generation.  It really is a sad book in some ways. It appears she wonders through history and culture and changes her perspective and desires without an anchor of truth. And yet her description of the culture and the feelings of each time period is excellent.  If you don't know French 20th century history or culture this book will be frustrating. Even if you do know it and French is your second language, you will likely have to look up many of the cultural references and look up the old fashioned and slang French phrases. Stopping and researching some of the more esoteric cultural references made my experience of the book richer.     ","Steve Stegman"

The author claims not to pursue self-discovery—but experience a journey from adolescence to older age. Apart from numerous references to French politics, there is tremendous reward is journeying through her life and insights, which become more universal as the book progresses. However, not sure if a male reader would connect as fully.","P. Rohrer-Walsh"
"A very unusual memoir, a memoir of her life but also of a generation told in multiple voices -- the third person as well as collective first person. She starts each decade with a photo and a personal story then shifts into the collective. The effect creates an intimacy and a distance, with both work together to show how lives and values have changed. A very interesting book.","Kate"
"The nature of time and how we remember is central in this intriguing "collective autobiography" presented as a novel.","RD Chiriboga Moncayo"
"Ernaux chronicles the life and experiences of those individuals (Boomers?..I can't keep track of all of these terms) who grew up in France. It's very much like her other novels where it's autobiographical. However, rather than telling her own story from birth to death, she focuses on her generation.  This is perhaps a controversial opinion but I didn't enjoy this as much as I enjoy her other works. I think this would've been more powerful if in the spirit of her other novels, she focused on herself and told her story...although, I guess she already has told her story...I don't know, there was something that I didn't enjoy as much as I wanted to.","no"

"The lucid, aware, intellectual grandparent we never had.  So much more to this than I can express here, but Ernaux is my choice western civilization, 20th century guide alongside Mathias Énard and Will Gaddis. France and the US have way more in common than especially France would care to admit, and this is why the French dislike us so much. Written well enough for me to trust the 'we' voice despite many misgivings about the option for one to speak for many. Breathtaking.  "as if now it were her turn"","lévi-civita"

"This book really grew on me as it was developing. I would say it’s soaked in a feeling of nostalgia, dripping from each paragraph, a nostalgia that definitely got me too, even though I did not even share the same times nor did I grow up in France.  The style of writing is beautiful, it flows from beginning to end, starting in the ‘40s, in the aftermath of the 2nd world war, and going up to the 2000s. In between, what struck me the most was -  the cultural shock between a generation that has lived through poverty and drama, to new, more spoilt, generations born in steadiness and wealth (or as the writer says, the older generations were stronger!)...  the evolution of women’s rights, subtlety and crudely laid out throughout time - with a rather sad conclusion that in the end, not that much has changed in mentalities...  the eternal, same, political debates, wars and violence and strikes and let’s face it, insatisfaction of the French (hehe)...  and finally, it struck me that so much time has lapsed between the 2nd world war and today, when technology and infrastructure have certainly advanced, but somehow mindsets have not changed that whole much and we are still carrying an old thought legacy, not learning from mistakes, repeating the same cycles over and over again, making our society struggles look a bit useless.  Needless to say, it left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth but for the right reasons I think.","Ioana G"
"'how would she organise the accumulated memory of events, and news items, and the thousands of days that have conveyed her to the present?' like this. It's amazing to achieve something that talks not only of the shared experience of the French working to middle-class movement of 1941-2006, but also a shared experience of growth amidst history. We all experience, as the 'narrator' does, political upheaval, apathy, new technologies, wars, Christmas dinners. Ernaux melds what happens in the background of a life, what's heard on the radio, into life, and history, itself. Through this, she balances the subjective and objective, showing that in reality the border is fuzzier than feels comfortable.  N.B. there are very racist moments in this book - it seems like an attempt to sum up a national mood, and not an advocation, but it gets a bit close to the bone on occasion.","George Millership"

"This memoir isn’t quite memoir. It’s really an account of French history and culture from 1940-2006, told through the narrative of the author’s life. I think that her use of third person pronouns throughout the book helped her to create more of an observational account of events rather than a self-absorbed memoir would. I was interested in her view of the politics and social uprisings experienced in France. Of course, as is expected from Ernaux, the writing is beautiful.","Lisa"
"A personal memoir that also lives as a memory of time passing and world events for each and every one of us. That's quite different from the 'I' of biography, and closer to a personal history of a time. The author describes 'the words' here as a palimpsest, something new but distilling many echoes from the past. But there is also a confession that this isn't quite the whole truth of the matter. This visualisation of ourselves as an echo from times past I suppose is mirrored in the lives of us all. And in the larger context is the struggle conveyed of an individual attempting to make sense of world events, and find a meaning and direction in them, on which a personal life might be founded. At times the life foretold here seems a stereotype of all our lives, and the stages that we must go through. There's the suggestion of a certain inevitability in how we're propelled through life's chapters buffeted by the storms of larger events on the world's stage. A complete inability of the individual to steer a course derived from a personal sense of being. And all belief systems (political, religious, commercial, etc.) are shown as worthless in the final reckoning. The reader is eventually left wondering what there is in this representation of a life that is deemed of value either to the individual or to society. What is to become the truthful representation of oneself? In this instance, the final objective was this work, the reflections on a life and time. It is life as a struggle, where the prosaic demeans. It has a sombre tone, a deep reality, and an elevated purpose. An infinite sense of bewilderment pervades, as if meaning will always be evasive. A thought provoking work that refreshingly defies categorisation.","Robert Slack"
"I was impressed by this book; by what it tried to do and succeeded in doing. However, I was rarely racing to get back to reading it so I won't give it a higher rating.  Ernaux does a great job of blending personal and collective memories to document her life and the life of her generation. The narrative takes snapshots from her life; pictures, news, movies, music, advertisements, to show how France has changed from the 1940s to the early 2000s. If you don't know much about French history (I didn't), that's OK. I found a lot of parallels with British history and also feel there is a certain 'universality' to the themes in the book; time passes quickly for everyone and the major events of your life quickly become 'history' and irrelevant to the next generation.","Ciaran Monaghan"
"More like a 4.7 for me. Initially, many of the abundant references to French political and popular culture were unfamiliar and off-putting, sending me to Wikipedia and Google Translate way too often. However, as the book progressed, the ebb and flow of the author's narrative, preserved by her extraordinary translator, really drew me in. The structure is complex and pure genius. You will be disappointed if you are looking for a personal "I" memoir. The Years is more of a collective memoir, a memoir of instances of time, the passage of time, the markers of that passage, experienced by one person but also by a culture.","Kim"
"For the first 15 pages or so, I couldn't imagine this book getting more than a three-star rating from me: its fragmentary, erratic style seemed to lead nowhere. But gradually, the text started to flow and became more and more engaging and gripping. This is, in fact, exactly how memories work: the remotest ones are fragments, images, and the closer to present you come, the more detailed the memories are. That is exactly what happens in the book, which frames the author's autobiography into the collective experience in French society. As a Dutch person, I could not grasp every reference, because many are so specifically French, but as a European and World citizen, there were enough A-ha moments: touche pas a mon pote, Mitterrand, Sartre, AIDS, etc. The closer it came to my own lifetime, the more I recognised and the more enjoyable reading became. The main regret I have is not having read this in French, because my feeling is that the English translation does not do enough justice to the original, of exemplified by the fact that parts simply had to be left untranslated, because they were so specific. Ultimately, the effect it had on me was a desire to write a similar book about my own lifetime, and wondering what events I would include in a book like this. So here you go, a five-star review!","Dolf van der Haven"
"I’m gathering my thoughts on this and have a feeling that’ll take awhile. It makes an incredible impact.  This was actually maybe 4.5 for me just because so many references went over my head, but as the translator notes that was going to be the case for most English readers and French cultural touchpoints. That was the only drawback. What an extraordinary memoir and use of form - it’s both personal and collective and somehow blends them both perfectly. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.  I have eight pages of highlighted lines in my ebook, but here’s the last one: “Save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Rennie"
""The Years" is a literary project--Ernaux writing of her life, not in first person, from 1940 to 2007. She intends it, and says so within the text, to be an 'impersonal autobiography.' This is a goal that she achieves. It's a life told in moments, in markers of time. She presents experiences in a collective, generational frame. Her 'she' is reflective of those who grew up with her--hearing older relatives talk about the wars, and then not talk about them. Being a young parent during the tumult of 1968. (It helps if you are aware of modern French politics as its currents are often reflected here.) This collective approach is generous in theory, but the book itself, as you might imagine, isn't a typically revealing memoir. Ernaux points to currents more than specifics--these are her observations, but they're applied to culture at large. She paces the book with objective descriptions of photographs at various times--child, adolescent, young adult, etc--which brings in a varied focus and writing style. This is a rich, layered project, but one that may be more admirable in theory than in the reading.","Glen Helfand"
"I have mixed feelings on this book. I really liked the way Ernaux used family meals as set pieces to describe the times, the customs, and her changing family. I liked her periodic use of photos as a way to show the passage of time and tell us something of her interior life. I also found her use of "we" and "they" and "she" rather than "I" intriguing, though sometimes confusing. And her view of the changes in French society during her lifetime was interesting.  Set against this was her use of lists, especially in the first half of the book. So many long lists! It made the book seem overstuffed at times. She also tries to speak for her generation but can really only speak for those in her milieu, which is by no means every French person of her generation (often it's not even a majority.) And her continual angst or melancholy (or whatever the right word is) eventually wore me out--was she ever happy in her life?","Keith Sickle"
"I found this book off-putting and impersonal at first, as the author tells the story of her life as part of the story of her time and place - a memoir using "she" and "we," but never "I." Did details belong to the author's life or to French history? I couldn't always tell, and after a while I didn't much care. But as the book neared the end, Ernaux's sentient self, as opposed to the description of her life, became powerfully real. I felt her aging and experiencing life and time in ways that are intensely personal and yet also cosmic. The book came together and, more important, affected me.","Cheri"
"Marvelous. A brilliant record of a life and, more broadly, a record of tumultuous, defining decades in France from 1940 through 2000. Ernaux, at least here translated into English, writes with beautiful, spare prose, handling the use of “we” with breezy facility. I am very impressed.","Abby"
"A contribution to the truth about reality, or the memories that are the truth.  This novel belongs to a series of novels that try to depict the history through the memoires of one person, or one family. “the story about the family was crucially attached to the story of the society” p. 24. From my country (Norway) there are two novels, one by Lars Saabye Christensen that tells the story of a small part of the city of Oslo during about the same time as Ernaux tells the story about France and the word. I do not remember that Stalin dies in the Christensen’s novel. Another six-volume novel by Ketil Bjørnstad tells the story of six decennials in Norway. I have not read it.  The nice thing about Ernaux’s novel is that it is short, still packed with meaningful details. Some of the details are recognizable, some are poetry.  Growing up in France versus Norway. Reading Ernaux novel is exciting in several ways. How did she experience growing up in France compared to our experiences growing up in Norway? I read Ernaux novel in Norwegian, and the translator must have made an excellent job translating children’s plays as I remember them from a Norwegian childhood. But it may be because of the translation. Furthermore, the world outside of France is by definition almost identical to the world outside of Norway, but not in the memories of the countrie’s people. However, if I were to write the same story from another place and from the flow of time in that place, what would it be like? My first reaction is that it would be more about the decisions that were made. So why did people in my place and in my time make more decision than Annie? We probably did not, but with the benefit of after¬thought, we did. However, also in after¬thought, the “she” in Ernaux’s novel had benefitted from afterthought. If she had willed. Here is a quote from Harry potter: “It is our choices Harry, that shows what we truly are, far more than our abilities”. And from Vivian Gornic “She enjoys thinking, only she doesn’t know it”.  Growing up in 29 sentences. When I came to a point in the text that gave me a Deja Vue, I found texts from other memoires that corresponded to the texts in Ernaux’s novel. The text fragments are not quotes. The page references are to the pages in Ernaux’s novel. 1. While the parent had a party, not really a party, we would sit in a corner and listen. It was the World filtered through parents and friend’s dis¬cussions among themselves. p. 20.  2. We were in love with Audrey Hepburn, but did not understand what “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” really was about. p. 50  3. We did talk about the Suez crisis, but more about the English decision to abolish capital punishment. p. 56  4. Bjørn ended school before artium. He was clever, but his parent thought he would do well working as a bank clerk. Then he would carry a suit and a tie. He read "castel-novels", that is, all novels that were set in a castle, and he did not have skis.  5. In the beginning, he was disappointed of the low ambitions Londoners had. p. 66.  6. If the result was a baby, we would marry. There was no baby.  7. Is jealousy really an old-fashioned feeling, here in London in 1982? p. 69  8. It was just a relief and the beginning. p. 76  9. L'Année dernière à Marienbad. p. 76  10. Others did not understand the idea of having telephone.. p. 86  11. Had you experienced something by being a woman, homosexual, you had the right to say "I" p. 103.  12. He had an uncle that were an innovator, but there are differences between the old and the new innovators. Therefore, he decided to be an innovator. However, “a novel cap on the toothpaste” disappeared as an option, but what was left was un¬known. Still, it was enough to make a choice, p. 115  13. His father decided that the old dishwasher dishwashing brush was sufficient. He never washed the dishes.  14. Our neighbors had TV. For us it belonged to the bourgeoise until we did not see the children anymore. They watched TV at the neighbors. p. 90  15. We proudly showed our parents a sofa made of old milk-cases p. 91. 16. Reevaluation of everything womanly, period desedation, breastfeeding, preparation of leek soup. p. 107  17 I remember one friend of my father, he asked questions to me as if he wanted to know the answer, I remember an uncle, he asked questions as if he would forget the answer before I responded. And he forgot. p123  18. Said she, “I will move out one day”. p. 134  19. When the church missed its most important field of action, the sex, it lost everything. P. 150  20. The mother was a bohemian. The result was the children washed their own cloths. p. 169  21 He gave his father «Dave Brubeck plays Bach» and it was returned. The father gave him Mahler’s 5th symphony, and it was returned.  22. Burchell is probably not a master as Flaubert and James, but he writes about what really happened. p. 186  23.The event was forgotten before it became part of a story. p. 189  24. Black suite. “It is Nice, and when you get to the party, you will forget it is not.”  25. The efforts between thinking and doing became shorter, in fact, so short that doing sometime came before thinking. p. 196  26. With e-mail People could be two personalities slightly sequentially, when a face was exchanged with a computer, personalities change as well. p.196  27. It is not Rembrandt’s self-portrait; it is Seurat’s sails on blue water. p. 201  28. He was cutting his hear in a hairdresser shop, and in the mirror in front of him he saw a film of two towers in New York being destroyed, again and again and again. Another catastrophe film, only, this time, before the hairdresser was finished, he understood that this was not an animation. Although, sometimes real life feels like an animation, and in some part of your brain, it is. p. 207  29. The collective self-examination gave us models to describe us self - language wise. p. 218  Conclusion. Among all the novels that are self-portraits (sort of) and descriptions of the near history, this makes me think more about other authors (and my own) lifes (even if it is lies) than most other novels. However, I miss the “she’s” decision making and her thoughts. “She” is disappointed with Mitterrand when everyone else are disappointed with Mitterrand. Addendum. In my Norwegian edition of this book there is a pun on p. 13 "I am not foolish... have you heard about the baker that was on the loaf until the Police took him in, great said Pipin the little.. " , which in the Norwegian language is rather fun, but not in English. What was it in French, and what was it in English?  Comments Kirsten: Not sure about the French but in the English edition the pun is "I'll be brief, said King Pepin the Short and climbing out of the monster's belly, Jonas declared, you don't need to be a brain sturgeon to know that's dolphinitely no minnow."

"[2008] Translated from French. (notes to self…) This is no ordinary memoir. Immediately wanted to reread it. The writing is absolutely gorgeous. Stylistically and on a sentence level. Practically every sentence beautiful and flag-worthy. Egoless. Memories as snippets and impressions rather than concrete specifics. The author embeds her own story in the bigger story of history over the course of her lifetime. She describes what she wanted to do like this (page 170): “She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” She accomplishes this in spectacular fashion.","Kirsten"

"All the images will disappear: Thousands of words, the ones used to name things, faces, acts and feelings, to put the world in order, make the heart beat...will suddenly be nullified turns of phrase that others used without a thought Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversations around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation. ...more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before. To save... the gaze of the black-and-white cat the moment the needle put her to sleep. To save something from the time where we will never be again.","Louise Paech"
"The Years is a narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the very selective recollection of memories of the French author, interspersed amongst the impressions, cultural habits, language, descriptions of photos, books, songs, radio, films, television, advertising and news headlines. The author does this in a chronological manner, interleaving personal recollections into more generalised commentary on social changes, with the personal comments integral to the narrative but feeling detached from the author, as she seeks to recall her thoughts at the time, as well as allowing some hindsight for comments on world events, such as the French fighting in Indo-China and then Algeria. Although some short phrases are left in French, these are generally easily understood, or for longer passages there are useful notes providing a translation, as there are also a few notes for particular matters, such as the names of the school years or textbooks known by their authors.  This book provides an enjoyable, but for demanding, insight into life as lived by an educated French woman during these years. Although the lists of books, films, actresses etc powerfully anchor the book in its time, they might also be considered a lazy shorthand for portraying the intellectual, cultural and political thoughts by trying to generalise the particular. This method works well when the reader recognises the references, quickly conjuring up the milieu. However I am British and twenty odd years younger than the author, so that many references are lost on me. I am unsure how this historical collage shorthand approach will be understood by someone another thirty years younger than me, or a non-European without the ability to quickly transform the lists into the milieu. For example, in a list of contrasts (for example Khrushchev/Kennedy) there is Peppone/Don Camillo; I know that these are the contrasting communist mayor and catholic priest from the Italian Don Camillo short stories, but these references are culturally time specific. A reference to Mylène Demongeot left me none the wiser, having to look up the name on Wikipedia (she’s an actress) and reference to a red staircase in a Soutine painting did not increase my understanding, being unable to locate a copy of the painting on Wikiart. When too many references are lost on the reader, they detract from the overall impression, they become like the lists of ancestors in the Old Testament.  I enjoyed the recollection of family reunions with the telling of anecdotes, familiar family stories, how they change over the years, which is skilfully portrayed at intervals throughout the book. It called to mind evenings at my grandparents when an uncle or family friend would visit and have supper, reminiscing (yarns) and gossiping over the meal.  To quote Ernaux: By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen. There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.  Overall, I am left conflicted. This is an outstanding and readable work of French social history, which does successfully work as an impersonal autobiography, although the closer the author got to 2006, the less persuasive it becomes. However because of its deliberately impersonal approach, I feel little empathy with the author telling her individual story, so that on the other hand, it becomes a book where history “is just one damned thing after another”.  My conclusion, it is successful French social history 1945-2000, leveraging off the personal specifically to fix the social history as lived experience. It is just confusing if you expect autobiography, which I had.   As an aside, I had just read One Two Three Four, a group biography of the Beatles, which includes a broadly contemporary narrative up to about 1960 when the Beatles started touring (Hamburg and England). From mentions in both books, I had never appreciated the cultural impact of Brigitte Bardot. In 1956-7 Ernaux pasted photos of Brigitte Bardot in And God Created Woman in her room and in Liverpool, John Lennon pinned up multiple posters of her in his bedroom.","Carlton"
"Stunning. An extraordinarily vivid and riveting recreation of France - intensely personal, yet objective and communal - since Liberation: poverty, pride, provincialism, gentility, authoritarianism, dreams, religion, family, ambition, sex (wanting it, having it, ashamed of it, fearing it), families, literature, generations, class, sexism, war, atrocity, drugs, politics, fashion, snobbery, forgetting, paternalism, sunshine, holidays, film, music, rituals, outdoor privies and consumerism, time and memory - all accounted for in these literary flashes of experience - almost a stream of consciousness - in fact, an onrush of unstoppable consciousness, a flood of life. This is history, time racing forward (to where?), a genre (if it is a genre) unlike any other, combining sociology, anthropology and 'auto-fiction' (whatever that is). At the outset the author creates a strong connection with the reader, who is helplessly caught up in the immense and fragmented narrative with a sense of instant recognition and almost overpowering feeling of empathy. Why does she do it? 'To save something from the time where we will never be again'. That sentence alone carries so much weight, so much pain, regret, sorrow, happiness. It's all about what it is to be human, I suppose - and it's quite brilliant.","John Fullerton"
"Loved this autobiography although I read it in the English translation","Steve C"
"This was a unique and powerful read. Though autobiographical in its form, Ernaux uses the life of an unnamed woman born in 1940 and captures the flow of her life till 2006. Ernaux, through the woman, records the tumultuous changes that swept through France and the world during this period. Growing up in the post World War French rural countryside, the memories of her parents, going to college in the 60s, the University Strike of 68, the Algerian War, Sarte and Beauvoir's looming influence, the explosion of free love, the eventual rise of the Right, the immigrant (Arab) influx, the Islamization of France, mass consumerism, the Chirac years, 9/11 and upto the coming of Sarkozy are the main pivotal points. Through all this, Ernaux captures the confusions and humanness of the mind of her heroine - love, marriage, parenting, children, domestic life, sexual escapades and the eventual coming to terms with the approaching end.  I loved it and learnt a bit of the French psyche. Having just finished a series of Houllebecq books, this added some additional perspective.","Manish"
"An interesting, concise novel that reads like a biography / autobiography, narrated in the third person by a French woman.

She comments on many topics including the advent of the television, the pill, feminism, student demonstrations in 1968, a socialist President, Algeria and the impact of immigration.

"Impressive, yet not enjoyable, The Years merges personal and cultural history, making neither particularly interesting.

"To begin with, I couldn’t understand what this book was about. It was just a series of unconnected sentences containing images or memories. No characters and no plot we would normally expect in a novel. I was ready to give this book a miss.  Fortunately, I spoke to a couple of my friends who were also reading the book and had read much more than me. They were very positive about it and encouraged me to continue. I am so glad that I did.  What the author has created I think is a completely original and different form of writing: a new way of writing a biography, one that intertwines memories with social and political events. So that it is not just a biography of the life of a woman but also a biography of France from 1940 until the beginning of the 2000s, an era of so many great changes to the way we live.  Her story was very much part of her generation’s story, a generation which has known changes which she describes as 'completement folle’ especially for the women.  Often the writing is poetical and, at times, I felt as if I was listening to a piece of music. A piece of music where you find so many of the refrains, notes and rifts go straight to somewhere familiar in your own head.  The more I read the more I became enthralled with this unique way of writing. As Annie Ernaux’s thoughts tapped into my own memories I would be taken away to scenes, for example, from my childhood past. The eloquence of her descriptions helped this process: "Everything in the houses had been bought before the war. The saucepans were blackened, the basins unglazed, the coats were repaired. Nothing was thrown away. The night buckets were used as fertiliser in the garden.”  Annie Ernaux’s writing is often described as autofiction, similar to the writing of Delphine de Vigan and Amelie Northomb, in that the starting point of her writing is her own life. However, it’s not clear that this is the case, partly because there is apparently little fiction, partly because her writing precludes the ego and also because the author herself denies it’s autofiction. Yet when the Guardian published an article listing ten works of autofiction, one of Annie Ernaux’s works is there among them.  As she writes in the book: “The memory never stops. It matches the dead with the living, real beings with imagined ones, dreams with history.” Her writing is full of thoughts on the nature of passing time. Annie Ernaux has remarked that time is the main character of the book.  Her writing combines her personal memories with more collective memories of songs, films, political and current events and changes in our daily lives such as the arrival of the Walkman, the right to abortion and May 1968.  She writes in the third or second person, never the first. So it ‘we’ and ‘she’ never ‘I’. Often she uses photos an an aide memoire, to help describe how people dressed, their social lives, for example, in an earlier era.  It would be impossible to comment on this fine work without mentioning the first and last sentences. The book opens with ‘All images disappear’. And it finishes with “Save something from time or there will be nothing. Clearly this book about time could be regarded as A Remembrance of Things Past for our times.

"At the end of a life, all we have are memories - and after that, they are gone. So begins and ends the sweeping retrospective of Annie Ernaux's life, The Years. Told from the unravelling associations from a series of photos (and, later, film), Ernaux captures freeze frames of what it's like to be alive, as a woman, at various points in 20th century France. Long, specific descriptions of the things people used to watch, listen to and talk about seem abstract and tedious at first (unless you've lived the same trajectory as Ernaux in France), but as objects and things build up, like dots of paint on a canvas, a fuller picture of the life Ernaux lived begins to emerge. Scattered through the endless facts and events - a war here, a protest there - are attempts at describing the inner life of the author. But the introspective forays are always from a distance, as if speaking about another, giving the book a genericness that many memoirs lack.  The Years takes a while to get going, but by the end I found myself wrapped up in Ernaux's life, despite it being from another time and another place. The prose, while sparse and uncomplicated, has a cumulative effect, slowly needling you into a rhythm and dragging you further and further in. Unique and captivating!","Alex Wilkins"
"In Annie Ernaux's "impersonal autobiography", she writes herself into the intersection between personal history and the collective memory of her generation. Instead of centering her memoir around the pronoun "I", she uses instead the pronouns "we" or "she" when referring to herself, or sometimes she uses "people". The book is an immersive retelling of a very specific version of French life (white, female, petit-bourgeois with working class parents) against the larger backdrop of historical events like the May '68 protests and the Algerian War. Her divorce, for example, shakes her out of a long period of lethargy just as she is thrusted into the Mitterand election in 1981 and then economic austerity in favour of the free-market economy. As the translator Alison L. Strayer notes in the afterword, there are many different times and "speeds" in the narrative, and sentences shrink or expand to contain multiple running threads as the story of Ernaux's life laps against the shore of history. For personal reasons, I was also especially moved by the earlier sections of the book when she is growing up and growing apart from her working class parents.   It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being–freeze-frames on memories, and at the same time reports on the development of her existence, the things that have made it singular, not because of the nature of the elements of her life, whether external (social trajectory, profession) or internal (thoughts and aspirations, the desire to write), but because of their combinations, each unique unto itself. To this ‘incessantly other’ of photos will correspond, in mirror image, the ‘she’ of writing.  There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.","Krys"
"Just unbelievable, one of those books that feels like it is ready to be a classic in the next couple of decades, and cements Ernaux as one of my favourite writers ever","Oliver Shrouder"
"There is a frog called Tiddalick in Aboriginal stories that steals water from all the creeks and rivers until a kookaburra discovers how to make him laugh and release all the waters needed for everyone. In parts of this book it feels that Annie Ernaux has swept up great swathes of her generation's history along with her own story as she, as she puts it 'devours the present". The book is narrated in sometimes overflowing, continuous style or staccato'd with photographic memories. It is a terrific read, rewarding and enlightening. You really feel part of her French generation beginning in 1940 and swept up in turns by the forces that history and life presents. Sometimes time itself is the subject as is the discursive way the author investigates how to create literary form from her mode of witnessing. Wonderful read! ","Natalie Davey"

"“Save something for the times when one isn't around anymore.“ Annie Ernaux wrote this "Les Années/The Years" (2008) some 25 years after her previous autobiographical book La Place (1984), and if you read the latter first – as I did -, then “Les Années” quite frankly is a relief. "La Place" was a harsh reckoning with her rural upbringing, and especially with her father, whilst this one is much more balanced and refined. It's the author's personal quest - at the age of almost 70 - for the life she lived and the times she went through.  Clearly, this book to Ernaux has been quite a struggle over how best to "grasp" her own life: to tell it from a personal, "I" point of view, or rather from an impersonal "she"? To start from her own life and experiences, or from the consecutive time periods she has gone through? To present it as a coherent story, or made up of varied and sometimes dissonant images and impressions? It are the methodological knots that every biographer, and especially every autobiographer, has to entangle. The interesting thing is that Ernaux gradually, and especially in the last quarter of her book, made this wrestling explicit, when she questions herself: «When the time comes to start, she (=the author) always stumbles on the same problems: how to represent at the same time the passage of historical time, the change of things, of ideas, of manners and the intimacy of this woman, to make coincide the fresco of forty-five years and the search for a self outside of History, that of suspended moments which she wrote poems at twenty, Solitude, etc. Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is in the 'I' too much permanence, something constricted and stifling, in the 'she' too much exteriority, of estrangement.”  Clearly, from the beginning you notice that she has opted for a rather impersonal approach, in which she writes about herself in the third person ("she/elle"), and in which she also interprets the spirit of the corresponding periods of time in the same style, through the impersonal "one/on". This means that Annie Ernaux only occasionally appears in this story as a real person, who struggles with the inevitable existential problems that arise in each specific phase of life. The priority apparently goes to that broader framework, call it the ‘Zeitgeist’, which she tries to capture in chains of objective events, names of politicians, books and films, mixed with memories and musings. She does this very associatively, sometimes without punctuation, like a loose chronicle.  This gives the misleading impression of being an objective account, but the opposite is true: this really is the subjective experience by a concrete person, a woman that was a typical product of the “trente glorieuses”, who broke away from her family environment, developed her own life, professionally and privately, and experienced both highs and lows. Moreover, this account definitely is a ‘remembered’ experience, written down at a much older age, and thus also reflective of sensitivities of later periods. Ernaux, for example, often addresses the gender aspect of the time periods involved: the gradual emancipation of women, that she experienced and also shaped herself, but of which she also sees the relative outcome: even now men keep on determining the image and the place of women, she notes bitterly. This bitterness is something that more and more seeps through in the later stages of her life: the growing distance from the world of her children, and from the enormously changing world in general. It’s a feeling of alienation that certainly gets more pronounced, as she ages.  Until the end of the book the ambiguity remains between the evocation of a concrete life - in her case from 1941 to the moment of writing around 2007 - and the evocation of the "spirit" of a certain historical age. Personally, I found the chronicle of the 1950s and 1960s, her adolescence and early adulthood, the most successful, because that period was also one of major social changes that would eventually culminate in the famous May-68 uprising and the subsequent hangover of the 1970s. The emerging youth culture and the switch to consumerism are beautifully illustrated. But after that her chronicle becomes a little more superficial and sometimes passes over certain stages of life very quickly. Her description of the 1980s and 1990s, for example, gets bogged down in a dry enumeration of facts and names, and she suddenly pays much more attention to the political developments, following the euphoria and subsequent betrayal by president Francois Mitterrand, apparently because she experienced this from up close.  This is a very rich and impressive book, without a doubt. It is very recognizable for those who have experienced more or less the same period; I am 20 years younger than Ernaux, but her evocation of the 1970s and 1980s certainly was very recognizable to me. However, her impersonal approach makes an empathic link with the person Annie Ernaux difficult, and that is certainly a downside. But this book contains enough elements of both self-reflection and reflection on the process of remembering and giving its own personal life story a place in history, to make it into a real classic.  Finally, a small warning: the French context is ubiquitous; readers that are not familiar with French politics, literature or, say, names of chain stores will occasionally find it difficult to follow her line of thought. Once again, it's a reminder of the fact that French culture is a world that is very much focussed upon itself. (rating 3.5 stars)","Marc"

"By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History [...] It will be a slippery narrative composed of an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes [...] To this 'incessantly other' of photos will correspond in mirror image, the 'she' of writing [...] There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we'  Formally experimental - though never inaccessible, even hypnotically compelling - this is the result of Ernaux's grappling with how to represent textually the experience of living through time. As such, it continues a long tradition of writing subjectivity and I'd certainly see this as in dialogue with e.g. Virginia Woolf, Proust (both name-checked in the text) as well as the later Outline trilogy by Rachel Cusk. Ernaux is self-conscious of her status as a woman, citing de Beauvoir as well as other feminist thinkers; and is equally self-aware of her lower-class French provincial birth and upbringing.  This is a book alive, then, to the ways in which we are acculturated and situated within the power structures of 'society': economic, political, social, cultural, gendered and racialised. Ernaux is as aware of how we might resist as well as the ways in which we conform or are complicit.  The narrative stretches from Ernaux's birth year, 1940, to 2006 and the telling is via a collage of 'moments' taken from everything from film posters, political slogans, best-selling books and key events, to two stories, one told in a 'we' voice ('on' in French but translated consistently as 'we' in English to keep the tone correct), and one via a third-person 'she' - the latter, disruptively, the most intimate. The inner and outer lives are thus represented from the big events that a generation experiences (May 1968, 9/11) to the atomised life of an individual - though I was constantly questioning to what extent even the 'individual' was, to some extent, a kind of 'female destiny' story told frequently through the body: first period, pregnancy scares, abortion, menopause etc.  In a kind of inversion of Sebaldian technique, the 'she' sections are headed by the description of a photo - a sort of ecphrasis - that punctuates both narratives, giving us a foothold in both the passing of time and the living life of 'Annie'. Photos become jumpy films then video, before returning to digital photos.  I see some reviewers found the Frenchness alienating through not recognising the political and cultural references but I never found this a problem - and, actually, I would suggest that what the book foregrounds is the communality of, especially, women's lives - we may take medical advances and contraception for granted (at least in the UK) but the flashpoints of adolescence, love, sex, motherhood, divorce, aging, losing parents are connections, however much they might be shored around by differing historicised discourses, values and ideologies.  Reading this review back, I realise that what is missing from my technical description of the book is how compulsively gripping and, yes, thrilling it is to read - the exciting formal and structural qualities do not overtake the interest of the narrative itself. The English translation by Alison L. Strayer is exemplary (I read some of this in French but I'm just too slow to have consumed the whole book that way) and has a quality of fluidity and pliancy, of organic being, that belies the very fact of translation.  For me, Ernaux is my find of the year - and someone whose books I'd recommend if you love Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy and intellectual foremothers such as Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir. I want to rush out and consume everything Ernaux has written immediately!","Roman Clodia"
"To see the world in a grain of sand...  What a remarkable book. Tracing her own life from the 40s to the 2010s, Ernaux creates a collective political and social history of France, and a good section of the rest of the world. Intimate, inclusive, unsentimental, this book helps us understand why we are at this historic juncture, our nations gutted by legacies of empire and/or neoliberalism, facing a turn to populism in a way few other books of such literary merit can.  Once again, the translation by Alison L Strayer is a pleasure to read.","Jayaprakash Satyamurthy"

"All our lives flow in a heartbeat with this collective (and yet personal) memoir from French writer Annie Ernaux, covering her life in France from 1941 until 2006.  Entirely written using the third person, this historic masterpiece divinely shows us how to create an eternal autobiography without ever typing the pronouns I, me or myself. Yes, the book does speak about a woman, but it could speak of all women. It doesn’t come up with a plot or chapters. You will find the first few pages hard to follow if you are not prepared to float on the nostalgic rhythm of memory, without a clear structure and main characters.  This unique collection of life fragments takes the reader on a journey, from the faded picture of the toddler in 1941 to the end of the second world war, to the social revolution and sexual liberation of the 60s and the new bipolar world in the 80s up until the arrival of modern globalisation, including women’s right to choose of their bodies and minds.  “You live in 1985, women can choose to have children if they want, when they want, outside of marriage. Twenty years ago that was impossible!”  Unifying our collective memory through visual lenses, we watch the protagonist (and protagonists) through pictures, photograms, the first TV adverts and radio songs into the political and socio economic context of France, feeling close to the same memories, even if distant in time.  This book comes back to today’s women as a wonderful way to reflect on our collective story, what has been, what will be. While we are forgetting what previous generations achieved, how life used to be, we gradually become aware that this unprecedented times could unite us in a timeless generation.  Stepping away from a fictional je, social changes, revolutions and human traumas remain part of the history as truly ours. What pervades the book from the beginning to the last page is the feeling of women’s in the years, through the constrictions and restrictions they have been suffering across time, constantly in search of their identity.  "We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be."  ","Paola"
"This was a gift from my wife Annika, so an extra star for that. More seriously, Annie tells her life in one long paragraph. Or let's say, it's rather her personal review of the last decades. Starting with the end of World War 2 and ending with people having mobile phones. Turns out history does repeat itself, at least I found it funny how even in the 70ies people were dreaming about leaving the city for a place with a garden. I enjoyed the book and don't really know why I didn't read it in less sittings. Learned a thing or two about France and it even mentions one of our last summer holidays (Trouville!).","Dan Zilic"
"I don’t know how to read The Years by Annie Ernaux if not by savoring it. It’s a memoir at its finest which, rather than accumulating only one’s personal story, encapsulates the nation’s narrative in which there’s also a place for slowly unfolding Ernaux’s story. As the book starts from 1940, the year in which Ernaux was born, at the beginning it seemed there were no things to mull over as they were hardly relatable. But I believe it’s not fair to think this way, though. I found that the phenomenon of wondering memory is the central theme of The Years (sort of Ariadne’s thread that helps the reader to get into the book), and hence, something that is relevant to me forever and ever. Although not belonging to Ernaux's generation, we might not completely understand what it means to live in 60’s France or so, but don’t we often try to unravel the mysteries of our minds, asking how our brain decides which memories to store and which ones to throw to us from time to time? I believe we do, and I believe this is the reason why I was enthralled by Ernaux’s fragmentary narrative that allows us to see the changes of society and national identity through Ernaux’s lens. She’s a sharp thinker, so it was delightful to have a guide like her who manages to broadcast such a range of topics without making the book too patchy, with such ease. The book is clearly haunted by nostalgia for the times that passed, but it’s a very hopeful memoir because it demonstrated how to make the past vivid again.","Monika"

"Update: Huge congrats to Annie Ernaux —- Nobel Prize of Literature for 2022.  “The Years”, a translated memoir, was shortlisted of the 2019 Man Booker International Prize. It starts in the year 1940....until Annie Ernaus’s sixty-sixth year. This my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I haven’t read her novels, yet.  I enjoyed the thoughts “The Years” stimulated about memories, aging, family stories from one generation to the next - the culture in which Annie grew up - the depths and influence the world wars had on Annie associated with family members who lived through those horrors of war..... And....I liked the narrative - the dinner conversations. I especially enjoyed hearing about her early childhood and teen experiences.  The rest of this review will highlight parts I liked - relating them to my own life-of-limitations.....(with those universal thoughts: again....yes, again, about love, loss, family, world and family history, and death).   “I’m capable of the best and the worst, but at being the worst I am the best!”  “Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation”.  “Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual differences and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others. United family members, neighbors, and all those whom one said ‘They’re people like us’, a repertory of habits and gestures shaped by childhoods in the fields and teen years and workshops, preceded by other childhoods, all the way back to oblivion”.   “We felt nothing in common with the ye-yes, who said ‘Hitler never heard of him, and their idols’, who were even younger than we: girls with pigtails and songs for the schoolyard; A boy who bellowed and writhed on the floor of the stage. We had the feeling they’d never catch up to us. Next to them, we were old. Perhaps we would die under de Gaulle”. “But we were not adults. Sexual life remained clandestine and rudimentary, haunted by the specter of ‘an accident’. No one was supposed to have a sex Life before marriage. Boys believed their lewd innuendos displayed advance erotic science, but all they knew how to do was ejaculate on an area at the girls body to which she directed him, for the sake of caution. No one knew for sure whether or not they were still virgins. Sexuality was a poorly resolved matter on which girls held forth for hours in resistance rooms no boy was allowed to enter”.  “She also imagines herself in twenty years trying to remember the discussions of today—everyone’s—on communism, suicide, and contraception. The women of twenty years from now is an idea, a ghost. She will never live to be that age”.   The narrator, her parents, and friends talked about the hardships in their early lives and the world wars. They told stories of distant cousins, ancestors and long-ago neighbors. The narrator says at this generation, that of the parents and earlier: “From a common ground of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ‘we’”. There were also many descriptions of photos - black-and-white - or home movies from different times of the narrator’s life.  Annie Ernaux was born in 1940. She grew up in Normandy. She taught high school from the years 1977 to 2000, and was a professor at the Center National d’Enseignement par Correspondence. She was considered one of France’s most esteemed living writers, her books have been subject to much critical acclaim. She won the prestigious Prix Renaudot for “A Man’s Place” when it was first published in French in 1984.  The translator, Alison L. Strayer is a Canadian writer and translator. Her work has been shortlisted for the Governors General’s Award for Literature and for Translation, the Grand Prix du liver de Montreal, and the Prix litteraire France-Quebec. She lives in Paris   I’m not French savvy....not anything savvy....but this short read - about 150 pages - kept me company during the dark sleepy hours - I felt a warmth of connectedness to Annie, her family, and the horrors of the world wars. I enjoyed this enough to want to read a novel by Annie Ernaux","Elyse Walters"

"4,5 - This wise autobiography attempts to capture a life embedded in a time. In my view it succeeds beautifully. The life cannot be seen as separate from the time, place and political and economic circumstances in which it was lived. In this case: France 1941-2006.  It is in fact very French - from the cultural and political references to the prevailing values of anti-market, anti-consumption, anti-American - which are nevertheless betrayed constantly.  I have one criticism: it is completely one-sided in its pessimistic assessment of modern society. Yes, our consumption patterns are evidently unsustainable and changes are urgently needed. No, owning more stuff does not make us more happy. But, technology and science have brought an incredible amount of good and happiness, and there is not a single recognition of that. Moreover, I strongly doubt that as human beings we have changed much, or even to the worse, over the past 70 years.","Ruben"
"This is a brave and ambitious book that explores a French woman’s personal life across over 60 years of postwar social and political change. The narrator relies on the “we” pronoun to recall her generation’s collective experience of influential events, personalities, products, songs, images, emotions and language.  I was most fascinated by her depiction of a bookish working class girl’s transition away from heavily religious provincial constraints in the 1940s and toward an independent lifestyle and career in the late 1950s and ‘60s. At war’s end, “We lived in a scarcity of everything: of objects, images, diversions, explanations of self and the world.” Religion governed holidays, morality and especially young women’s lives. Higher education was widely viewed as a suspicious effort at upward and outward mobility. We learn that, even in small-town Normandy, class distinctions were ingrained. The narrator, daughter of a rope factory worker, is increasingly embarrassed by her family’s small café-grocery and backyard outhouse.  Once rationing receded, new products began appearing with stunning speed: Bic pens, Tampax, Dacron, canned vegetables, Vespas, transistor radios, TVs. As teenagers gained access to the new birth control pills, the prospects for independence from religious and parental strictures expanded enormously. “The Church no longer terrorized the teenage imagination or ruled over sexual exchange. Women’s bodies were freed from its clutches.” Consumer mania for these new products is a central concern of the book: “The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”  As she enters her teen years, the narrator sees herself as among the “ignored, good students without luster or repartee” who thinks about – but stays away from -- boys all the time and yearns to “flee her humiliating and unimportant little-girl body.” She devours existentialist novels and philosophy, adores The Second Sex (1949) and dreams of becoming a new Simone de Beauvoir. “For girls, shame lay in wait at every turn. The verdict of too loomed large:” in skirt length, makeup, dating, accomplishments, ambition, independence and more.  For all her rebellious thinking, the narrator never mentions any female friendships and follows the standard path of marriage, children and a move to the commuter suburbs (Cergy, north of Paris). “The shopping center, with its hypermarket and arcades, became our chief habitat.” She watches aghast as retailers accelerate shopping seasons, jamming Christmas goods onto shelves earlier and earlier. “Commercial time invaded calendar time.” Surprisingly, she stops well short of considering the staggering implications of unbridled commercial power for economic inequality, pollution and climate change.  I was most disappointed by the near-total absence of anything here about her 40-plus years of teaching. We are told only that: “She experiences her job as a continuous imperfection, a sham.” She writes in her diary that: “Being a teacher tears me apart.” Why? She yearns for the retirement into a writer’s life at 60 -- made possible by her “comfortable income of a teacher with seniority.” That work life may be covered in her other books that I’ve not yet read, but this still seemed to me a glaring omission here.  More attention to her decades of engagement with young students could have revealed more agency in the author than is evident in much of the book. She devotes page after page to dutifully recounting snippets on every national election and president, the Algerian War, May ’68, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment and Jean-Marie LePen, the AIDS crisis, the Gulf War, Y2K, the September 11th attacks and Islamaphobic responses. But, on present evidence, her interest in global events never translates into much travel outside France. And, aside from joining a few large marches, she is apparently a passive observer. Not for her joining, much less organizing, feminist organizations, political parties, community groups or labor unions. She comes across as a concerned, articulate, but otherwise very average middle-class suburban woman of the left, mostly watching the world go by on her TV.  I felt that the tone of the book was overwhelmingly melancholy and mirthless – a meditative, rather isolated and self-effacing white heterosexual woman looking back from old age at how she and other French women like her tried to navigate their many personal and national challenges. Still, this is a bold, frank and well-written “slippery narrative;” one woman’s thoughtful effort to battle the impermanence of our images and collective memory of six tumultuous decades.

"The Flux of Her, and Their, Memories, 1941-2006  All the images will disappear -the woman who squatted to urinate on broad daylight, behind the shack that served coffee at the edge of the ruins in Yvetot, after the war, who stood, skirt lifted, to pull up her underwear and then returned to the cafe -the tearful face of Alida Valli as she danced with George Wilson in the film Long Absence...   A 6-page-long list of seemingly unconnected imagery, news headlines and French quotes may not be what a reader is expecting from the opening pages of an autofiction (autobiographical fiction). While the main text is not as fragmentary as the list suggests, it is fair to say the perception of this award-sweeping work may hinge on how comfortable the reader is with this less coherent format and the author's candid yet tranquil tone, observing and commenting on all, pleasant or not, corners of a society . To an Asian reader , it's a one-of-a-kind experience to learn about a woman and her generation in post-WW2 France but at times less accessible to readers not living in that country (or not speaking the language).  It is a sepia photo, oval-shaped, glued inside a little cardboard folder with a gold border and protected by a sheet of embossed, semitransparent paper.  Tracing the life of the author from her childhood to her sixties, this text replaces the usual markers of chapters and dates with text-only description of family photographs, followed by moments of the author's life, news and observation of that time, plenty of cultural references (always in French) and social commentary, before moving on to the next photograph when the cycle begins anew, written in the singular "she" and the collective "we" or "they". What a French girl (and later, a teenager, a teacher, a wife) could, or should, do at that time is one of the recurring themes , the others being the materialistic culture of her social milieu and French politics after the nation-wide strike in 1968. On top of these, the narrator also stresses on about her own relationship with literature and her urge of writing everything in a book, probably in the one we are now reading, which plays an important role on the ending.  And we, on the threshold of the 1980s, when we would enter our fortieth year, were suffused with a weary sweetness that came of accomplished tradition, and gazed around the table of faces, dark against the light. For a moment we were struck by the strangeness of repeating a ritual in which we now occupied the middle position between two generations. We were overcome with a kind of reverse vertigo, brought on by immutability, as if nothing in society had moved.  This book stands out with its ambition to go beyond the genre of autofiction by painting a panorama of the society, not only from the perspective of a particular lady, but also from the perspective of a generation of ladies. Using pronouns like "we" and "they", the author fuses the individual and personal with the collective, the political and the French, reminding us our personal matter is often the result of the invisible power dynamics between capital and politics ,and what is called politics is often the heartfelt emotions and experience of our fellow citizens.  The author does use plenty, or some may say full to the brim in several pages, of French cultural references, especially brands of product, celebrities and politicians ,that may pose some difficulty to non-French readers but I can say this issue is less prominent in the second half of the book. As a whole, it's a work not to be missed by everyone into the postwar era, feminism or experimental writing.","CM"

"The Years is a uniquely styled memoir and social history. Ernaux distances herself somewhat from the personal nature of her memories by maintaining the first person plural "we" throughout the book. This is not just her story but also the story of her generation. In places time moves rapidly and then suddenly stops (or "freeze-frames") as Ernaux focuses in on a specific memory or sensation, often described along with a corresponding photograph.  I found myself particularly interested in the (often confusing) evolution of her sexual identity, which resonated with me significantly. "We strongly sensed that with the pill, life would never be the same again. We'd be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man." Also, notable to me was the temporary dissolution of her inner self and inner life as she met the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a mother.  Additionally, I noted her frequent reflections on her/their relationship to material goods and consumer culture. "The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs." .... "From Darty Appliance to Pier Imports, the desire to buy leapt up inside of us, as if to acquire a waffle iron and a Japanese lamp would make us a different person." .... "With pleasure or annoyance, lightness of heart or deep despondency, depending on the day, more and more, the acquisition of things (which we later said we couldn't do without), was life's magnetic north."  Skimming through the places I've marked in the book, I realize how much of it is an investigation of sources of happiness. Where is happiness supposed to come from? Social climbing? Material acquisitions? Sexual freedom? Spouse and children? A respected profession? As Ernaux's "we" accumulates these accolades and milestones, her narration still feels lost, adrift and without fulfillment. "And we, who knew very well that a 'secure profession' and money didn't necessarily bring happiness, couldn't help but want happiness from them."  I am glad that I read A Man's Place before reading The Years because it gave me a better sense of Ernaux's personality and history before tackling this "slippery narrative." The translator's note was placed at the end of this edition. I wish I had read it before reading the book. The translator's explanations and descriptions would have been much more helpful that way.","Laura"
"Relieved to finish this collection of memories, a style I would like to write for myself as documentation, but while reading someone else's, Annie Ernaux's, full of names, locations, acronyms, etc. in French, I was detached shortly after starting. I agree with Lucy Dacus's thoughts.","Vicky"
"Great writing about the events of the 20th century and its cultural implications and impact on the life of a woman. This book rushes past you like life itself, leaving you with diffuse impressions rather than a definitive story line. Contains many quotable, relatable sentences.","Josy"
"My Annie Ernaux affair continues.  Finished The Years by Annie Ernaux today.  So good. Beyond brilliant.  Different from her close and intimate memoirs Happening and A Girl's Story. In fact, I recommend reading these first because they are the key to the more personal aspects of The Years.  The Years is an autobiography unlike any I've read. So cleverly structured as to firmly place the personal story within its historical setting. It is a way of telling which highlights how much a part of our times we are, and yet allows room to underscore the subject's individuality.  I'll have to read it again. ","John Purcell"
"Beautiful, beautiful memoir that merges the life of an individual with the story of a nation. Full review later. --------Full Review----------------------------- 4.5 stars  "Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How the make the fresco of years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended memories transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty..."  'The Years' is a beautiful memoir that captures the life of Ernaux as the voice of French life from 1940 to 2006. Written in the first person plural, it expands a single woman's life to that of her nation, and focuses, without diminishing, the idea of French existence to a woman's POV during les années(the years). Using a handful of photographs as pillars marking pivotal moments, it branches into the French culture, society, political landscape, economy, and what not, and lets you see the country from an eye different from that of textbooks that would have reduced it to definitive moments; all the while blending it with the reflections of a woman processing the changes within herself and the nation, both aging and evolving.  Like life, there were moments of profundity in the beginning and end, while the middle sagged a bit. The endless list of French politicians, TV shows, and unelaborated cultural moments were tough to keep up with (and frankly weren't worth remembering) but the idea that every ordinary man lives through history and a specific way of life that is forever unique, completely fascinated me. The translator, Alison Strayer has done a brilliant job.  When I mentioned this book to a friend, he asked me if a book like this could be written within the Indian imagination. I'm not sure it can for I don't know if a definitive 'Indian' life exists, and I don't have confidence in narrowing (without reducing) the diversity of Indian life into one voice. I'd love to see someone try though!","Chaitanya Sethi"
""Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History."    Ernaux's writing style is experimental and takes a bit getting used to but it isn't tedious or remote. Its lyrical cadence and magnetic grip draws you in quickly. A narrative about being in time & traversing through it, it works as personal memoir but is also larger memoir of a country - the autopsy and the exhumation of the national conscience, reckoning with the past and the shadow it casts. Its voice, majorly first person plural "we", considers one generation of French women as a collective, specific gaze turning all-encompassing, speaking en-masse, a sort of communal socio-cultural commentary.  Ernaux also avoids the use of "I" when she is only talking of specifically herself. Using the third person "she", to distance herself in what she calls an "impersonal autobiography... a story of the time-before". This duality in voice plays a role in how the book looks back with a curious mix of naivety and cynicism, affixing irony to casual orientalist attitudes and a myopic understanding of the wider world, tracing complicity & resistance in the precarious play of power that imbues all systems. Its distinct Frenchness isn't alienating. Brilliantly & fluidly translated by Alison L Strayer, Ernaux tries to "save something from the time where we will never be again."","Areeb Ahmad (Bankrupt_Bookworm)"
"It was a very different we language autobiography with remarkable narrating.

"My Annie Ernaux experiment continues. I arrive at this much longer book than many I have recently read, knowing only that several more worthy readers have called it her masterpiece.  All I can say is that it is not my favourite.  Yes, it is full of insightful brilliance, but for me I struggled with Ernaux for the first time, simply, I think, because I am not French. I can speak a little of the language, I have lived there for a few months of my life, I have read many translated French novels and have been lost in the beauty of French cinema, but I am not close enough to French culture to really get the most out of this book. I was not there for the political wrangling, the popular songs or television adverts. All these little elements bring a time and place back to mind with incredible clarity. Give me a book which quoted all things British over the same period and I would not only feel completely at home, but the references would carry a happy nostalgia. That is what I am missing with this book.  Ernaux begins the book with a long list of all the images that will disappear and hits us with this little masterpiece of a paragraph:  They will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among the grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.  There are a lot of one liners at the beginning of the book. Then the question “what were you doing on 11 September 2001?” I looked at it and because distance dulls things, it takes a second. (And because the English would say 11/9 not 9/11, it takes a beat to remember.) But I know exactly where I was and that we were just starting a phone call with part of our team in New York, just across the road from the Towers, who narrated the start of that day to us in their confusion and uncertainty, before we peeled out of the meeting to our computers to watch events unfolding on our monitors, just before we, only twenty floors up in London, were sent home too. Yes, I remember so much about that day.  While sex is something of a preoccupation in this book, it is a huge one in adolescent minds and Ernaux captures that in these lines:  Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight skirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternizing of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked and crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into the ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone. In these conditions, we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. We had to live with our yearnings for this pleasure that was considered the preserve of adults, which clamoured for satisfaction at any cost, despite all attempts at prayer or diversion. Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics, and whores.  The book has a long timeframe, from childhood to old age. It gives insight not only into how Ernaux saw herself but also the events around her. The awakening of feminism comes with a divided mind, between those that promoted equal rights for the sexes and those that promoted everything feminine – “…periods, breast feeding, and the making of leek soup.”  But for the first time, we envisaged our lives as a march towards freedom, which changed a great many things. A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.  As the book progresses it becomes more of an account of Ernaux’s life. Because I have read some of her other books [A Woman’s Story, A Man’s Place, Simple Passion] there are fragments here of her life that I recall from elsewhere. In this book we see a more complex timeframe with children growing into adulthood. I found reflections on their passing lives very enjoyable:  Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth: the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.  One of the things that I didn’t really consider until just now was the order in which her books were written. So as I look for the first time I realise that Simple Passion, her account of a two-year affair with a married man, was published in 1991 while The Years was 2008, nearly twenty years apart. This passage, as she looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, harks back to the events in that earlier book:  In that moment, as she gazes softly at the lens – it is undoubtedly a man taking the photo – she sees herself as a woman who, three years before, was consumed by a violent passion for a Russian. Her state of desire and pain has disappeared, though she still feels its shape. The man’s face grows increasingly distant and aggrieved. She would like to recall the way in which she thought about him after he left France, the torrent of images that washed over her and sealed his presence inside her, as if inside a tabernacle.  I never cease to be amazed at how candid Ernaux can be about her own life. She does it with such apparent ease:  Certainly, as at other times with her sons, when she takes on the mothering role she assumes only occasionally, she feels the limitations of the maternal bond, her need to have a lover, a kind of intimacy that only the sex act can provide, which also consoles her in times of passing conflict with her sons. The young man she sees on alternate weekends often bores her, gets on her nerves by watching Téléfot on Sunday morning. But if she gave him up, she would cease to communicate the significant acts and incidents of each day. She would no longer put daily life into words. She would stop waiting. She’d gaze at the lace stockings and thongs in the chest of drawers and tell herself she’d never wear them again. And when she heard Sea, Sex and Sun she’d feel cast out of an entire world of caresses, desire, and fatigue, bereft of a future. At that moment, just to imagine it, the sense of deprivation violently attaches her to the boy as to a ‘last love’. She knows the main element of their relationship is not sexual, not as far as she’s concerned. Through the boy she can relive something she thought she would never experience again… And is the sensation itself not a product of history, of such great changes in the lives of women and men that one can feel it at the age of nearly fifty-eight, lying beside a man of twenty-nine, with no sense of wrongdoing, or indeed of pride?   As we pass through the years of memories, Ernaux is happy to take pot shots at anyone, be they French politicians, Putin, or the Americans in general. “  We were increasingly irritated by the Americans’ moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was ‘arrogance’. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles – don’t rely on anyone but yourself – gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of ‘another world’.  Her statements continue to make us stop and think – one of the reasons that I love them. Take this for example:  We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSL, and the flat screen TV. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions. The questions that arose with the appearance of new technologies were cancelled out as their use became second nature, and required no thought. People who didn’t know how to use a computer or a Discman would become obsolete, like those who couldn’t use a phone or a washing machine. In nursing homes, an endless parade of adverts filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of ever possessing.  As we draw to the end of the book, Ernaux increasingly looks backwards at her life and the passing time. No-where is this better illustrated than during the ritual of Christmas with the arrival of older children now with children of their own:  The private life of couple was re-formed and dispersed in their respective cars. Silence descended. We removed the leaf from the table, started the dishwasher and retrieved a piece of doll clothing from under a chair. We recognised the weary plenitude of having once again ‘been a good hostess’, harmoniously navigated all the stages of a rite in which we were no the oldest mainstay.   Still a four-star read, still fascinating and insightful, but simply not my favourite.","Marcus Hobson"
"Not that interesting","Birthe Pedersen"
"This is a patchwork-book, between autobiography and nonfiction, telling the life of its author and of her generation in parallel. Some overarching themes were present throughout the book, a bridge between the author’s interests and the objective markers of her generation: feminism and the sexual liberation, capitalism and the société de consommation that ensued, the interest in world events and social causes, among other things.  As I was born in 1996, I came too late even for the latest events in the book: I remember the change of currency in 2002, from franc to euro, because we had to give the franc coins back, but that’s it. I didn’t live in that time, I have no nostalgy for it, but I liked that it helped me understand quite a lot about the current France.  Annie Ernaux talks a lot about the sexual liberation and the empowerment of women thanks to the pill and the abortion, as well as the right to *finally* talk about it. This right to talk about sex seems to have crystallized in an imperative: to show that you weren’t a prude, that you weren’t easily shocked, you had to use crude words. I know that my grandmother has never gotten over this particular powermove, and still loves using crude words and doing forbidden things (like breaking traffic laws at 80yo…). It always bothered me, but now I think it's partly a generational thing, the appeal of what was previously forbidden.  There’s also a lot on the subject of consumption, capitalism and globalization. The fascination with modern objects, the showing off, the difficulty to adapt for older people, etc. And on the subject of globalization, I was kind of shocked to realize that it was much easier for the previous generations to share the same cultural references. They read the same French authors and philosophers, liked the same French and American singers, watched the same TV channels and news reports, etc.  I wonder how integrated in this 20th century she really was: she only talks about 20th century, but is it caused by the constraints of the book (where she mostly shows the ways her life and her generation’s history intersect) or by a genuine appetite for newness at the time, that she also shared? She did say at some point that her generation thought 20th century books felt more appealing and worth reading than older classics. Was it an effect of the postwar era, this rejection of everything from before the war?  This mix of autobiography/nonfiction was particularly jarring for me. This focus on the 'generational' parts of her life means that she omitted her personal feelings towards friends and family members. The timeless human traits, unrelated to the big themes listed above, only appeared in passing. Which I thought made her seem distant and materialistic (who cares about frozen peas and product brands!), which she probably wasn’t. So it’s a distorted kind of autobiography! I knew it in a distant kind of way, but in practice I constantly forgot about it, and thought: okay, but how did she really feel about her ex-husband? and her new boyfriend, apart from the fact that he makes her feel younger?  And when she presents her generation as a united front on all the big themes listed above, she’s not trying for objectivity or inclusivity. Which is very obvious, but I wanted to read these "we"-sentences as nonfiction, as universal truths of her generation. So she was talking about how "we" adulated Sartre and Simon de Beauvoir, and I thought, wait, that's not true, I know someone born in the 40's who can't stand them. Oh, right, not nonfiction either.  Unrelated to the autobiography/nonfiction genre-bending content, the prose was beautiful, épurée ("uncluttered", but there must be a better translation?) and made me want to read more in French.","Joséphine"
"I have read three books by Annie Ernaux in a row that I am commenting in this same review: La Place (1983 - Engl: “A man’s place”), Une femme (1987 - Engl: “A woman’s story”), Les années (2008 – Engl: “The years”). I read the two first in French, the original language, and the latter in the Norwegian translation.  I really liked "La Place". I found the story touching. Annie Ernaux writes about her memories of her father without romanticizing. Despite the sober descriptive style, one can feel a deep admiration for the father. A courageous man issued from a poor background who managed to modestly climb the social ladder. A father who encouraged his daughter to study. In the second part of the novel, the gap between father and daughter grows. Annie Ernaux describes this gap without judging. The simple and realistic writing brings us very close to the father. But it is more than an autobiographic story, it is a universal story. I see no shame in this story. Rather Annie Ernaux wants us to remember the story of many who were born in the beginning of the 20th century. So close to us.  I also liked “Une femme” but in a less extent. I found the first part of the story repetitive with the first part of “La place”. This is not surprising as the parents met and start building a new life together. I also lack the simple and clean writing style of “La Place”. Beyond being a social story, “Une femme” also depicts the challenging relation between mother and daugther. The disagreements and quarrels, and a tight, grateful and loving relationship. Teenager, Annie Ernaux gets ashamed of her mother, but is it a shame due to the social gap or due to the complex relationship? Despite the social gap, Annie Ernaux tells she has never been so close to a woman.  I did not enjoy “Les années” at all. Poor translation? The style is completely different from the two other books. Some parts written as list of memories and facts are very cumbersome to read. They rather seem to be a draft. Despite it is an autobiographic story Annie Ernaux distances herself from the story. It is about “she”. I understand it is a way to get an external glance on oneself, but I also become a distant reader. I feel that I cannot get in this story. It is also about “we”, but who are “we”? Did we all experience this story? I feel that this wwe is non inclusive. “Les années”, trying to be universal, fails to be universal. I stop reading half part of the book. ","Jacqueline"

"In the novel Years, Ernaux adopts an offbeat style of narration. The novel alternates between the lifestory of the author and the social, cultural and political happenings in France and to some extent, across the world, through the gaze of a woman living through all those changes. Ernaux outlines the evolution of her identity as a woman and writer across the 'Years' stretching from the times of WWII till 2006. In her words, 'the fresco of 45 years coinciding with the search for a self outside of the history'. The lifestory converges with the story of France during these years.  The book is more like a scrapbook. The autobiographical parts of the book is narrated in the form of descriptions of photographs. It is like those photos are stuck on the wall of the history. Interestingly, Ernaux refers to a 'she' ( protagonist) in this autobiographical work. As the protagonist says,"there is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote". Also, I feel it refers to a pov from French women in general who bore witness and were affected by the changes happened around them. 'She' becomes not just synonymous with Ernaux but also, as mentioned in the blurb, a marker of the collective autobiography the book is. "She was convinced that she has no personality."  In some of the autobiographical parts, Ernaux contemplates on the process of writing and the use of language. At times, she gets weighed down by her memory and knowledge and aspires to write in a 'language no one knows' and which bears an 'original purity'. At the same time she also understands her book's form can come into being only by weaving together the threads of her memory and years of changes to the lives of others. In short, a collective memory gets etched in an individual memory.  Honestly, it was quite tiresome to read through some portions detailing French politics and leaders. It took me sometime to comprehend her language and discordant form. But I loved this book for the sheer brilliance of her unusual craft and use of memory as the narrative tool to bring out a book which transcends genre definitions.","Chythan"
"There's a Citroën Deux Chevaux on the cover of my edition of this Annie Ernaux memoir. I have a memory related to a car like that. It was on one of my early trips to France as a student, and I barely knew how to drive. The owner of the car insisted I take his car for a spin but what with the steering wheel being on the opposite side, the gear shift looking like an umbrella handle, and me being very much in awe of the car's owner, my feet mistook the pedals and I pressed the accelerator to the floor instead of the clutch. The poor car did a dreadful shuddering lurch and its owner ordered me out of the driving seat sur le champ! That embarrassing moment embedded itself deep in my memory. It is always ready to rise to the surface whenever I see a Deux Chevaux.  Many of my memories are in the form of such images, brief glimpses of moments in time, captured by my internal image maker. The images are of things that inspired or moved me, that woke me up or shocked me deeply. They don't surface very often but when they do, they have as much clarity as things I registered only yesterday. When I try to situate them in their wider context however, I often run up against a blank. The time that lead up to them, the time after them, is gone. There is nothing but the moment itself, isolated like a photo in an album. Some of them may not even be real memories. I may have invented them, perhaps from an anecdote I heard or something I've seen somewhere. There is no way to know which are real but it doesn't matter because they are all part of my memories, part of who I am.  Annie Ernaux's memories are much clearer than mine. When she focuses on isolated moments from her past, she doesn't rely on internal images as I seem to do, though she has many of those to draw on and they fill the beginning and end pages of this memoir which have the feel of a dreamlike movie made up of unconnected scenes. However, the body of the book is much more concrete, devoted as it is to a meticulous examination of photos from Ernaux's family album.  When she examines her selection of photos, she doesn't say, this is me on a day trip to the seaside in 1948 aged eight. Instead she talks about the girl in the photo in the third person, but refers to the girl's generation as 'we'. The 'we' gets much more focus than the 'she'—Ernaux seems driven to merge her personal past with that of her entire generation, and she succeeds very well.  Her France is very vivid, and her analysis of the details of its history, culture and politics feels very accurate. There is no nostalgia, no sentimentality. She is setting down the record because she is aware that France has changed a lot in her lifetime. She remembers a time when there was continuity between the past and the present, when people spoke of the Algerian war, WWII, WWI and even the Franco Prussian war, around the Sunday dinner table. A time when, if people spoke of the future, they had fixed images of it, personal spaceships and robots, etc. In 2006, which is as far as she goes in this memoir, she speaks of the past being uninteresting to the newer generations, and the future, unimaginable. Continuity between the past, present and future has somehow been lost.  I appreciated this book for the way it restores my sense of the continuity of history. After many visits to France as a student and young adult, I moved there in the nineties and reared my children there. Living in the country on a permanent basis, I began to notice things I'd never seen on my previous visits, things like the alienating fringe of warehouse shops on the outskirts of every town, selling everything you needed to set up house. There was always a super-sized supermarket in among those warehouse shops, with checkout desks that seemed to stretch for miles. Those supermarkets sold all sorts of cheap preprepared food that shocked my notions of French eating habits based on holiday experiences of old quaint streets and market places where everyone seemed to buy fresh food and prepare it themselves.  When I read Ernaux's account of those years, I realised that she was as destabilized by the appearance of such huge commercial outlets as I was, and that she was also noticing the changes in people's eating habits as working lives got more stressful and there was no one at home slowly and carefully preparing food. But she never sounds nostalgic (as I might). No, she always sounds objective, just recording all the changes, and revealing how they happened. Her memoir is like a documentary film of 66 years in the life of a country. It is the best kind of history.","Fionnuala"
"Brilliant. I haven't read such a fantastic memoir in a long time.","Lavinia"
"essentially a memoir written in first-person plural, ostensibly as the voice of "a generation", from 1941 to 2006. occasional sections describing personal photographs and family dinners, where the author refers to herself as "she". the book is notably chock full - like almost every page - of references to french history and pop culture.  i think the negative reviews aren't very fair. criticisms include: the interminable amount of references (a lot of which would probably be obscure to non-french people, including me), the lack of real characters or plot, being boring and lacking emotional engagement.  i actually enjoyed the references. i didn't feel like i needed to understand every single one to be able to grasp the book, although it was interesting occasionally searching up some random politician or singer or scandal or other that was mentioned. it made me feel more immersed in the book's portrayal of france through... the years. and the criticism of lack of characters and plot is weird, given that the voice of the author is pretty clear throughout, including her feelings regarding historical events, her gradually changing mindset towards time and memory, etc. and the plot is... history.  something something about intertwining the personal and the political, showing how historical events and cultural changes affected individuals... it's okay. the examples of this i enjoyed had to do with progress in women's rights, and the advent of the consumer society, which are both discussed in detail at multiple points.  not so well done: discussion of france's social problems like xenophobia and AIDS. i get that she's conveying the attitudes of the people, but at some points the book comes across as dismissive, as if endorsing those viewpoints without much consideration. for example:  It swelled and encircled the cities, flooded suburban high schools, the National Employment Agency, the northern line of the RER, and the Champs-Élysées on December 31... They were officially called "youths from immigrant backgrounds", or in daily life, Arabs and Africans, or to employ a more virtuous phrasing, les Beurs and les Blacks. They were IT professionals, secretaries and security guards. That they called themselves French we privately found absurd, a usurped claim to glory to which they were not yet entitled.  also, in general, i just didn't find the personal sections, describing her photos and the stories behind them, to be as interesting. maybe i just didn't always see the point. and i understand why she would talk about the young lovers she has as a middle-aged divorcee, or about the process of writing this very book (like, she literally mentions her thinking process of how to craft a book combining french history with personal experiences), but honestly that didn't add much for me.  what i'm saying is, sometimes the feeling that it was written by an old white french literature teacher really comes through. i don't think that's fully the intention but it is probably better enjoyed if read with a critical eye, ala mrs curren.  finally: the (rather pretentious) blurb overpromises. i don't think "a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective" or that it was "an intimate memoir 'written' by entire generations." i think it very felt much felt like one woman's experience of history and society, along with occasionally astute observations on the feelings of others in her generation. which is not bad, just not what is promised. this was my personal biggest gripe.  anyway, not sure if i'm as impressed as other people by the form or ambition or whatever, i'm more so just impressed by her really good memory lol. maybe my intellect is not powerful enough to comprehend her ambitions and accomplishments. i realise i sound rather negative so don't get me wrong, it did have its poignant moments. j actually enjoyed it a lot at the start which waned as i went on. in any case it could be quite fun if you have a wikipedia tab open on the side","Yong Xiang"
"The descriptions for this book don't do justice to the work. It's always called a "personal memoir" told through "memories of objects", which is so elusive it doesn't really mean anything. So when I got it in a book subscription, I was disappointed; who wants to read about someone digging through her photo albums?  But The Years is so much more than it's made out to be. It's a personal memoir, but it's much more about the communities the narrator belongs to as she grows up. In this way, Ernaux tells a story that's less about herself and more about Lillebonne, where she grew up, and provincial France in general; Paris during the late 20th century; and her family and friends. The Years is best seen as an informal history of France from 1940 to 2007 where the narrator is something of a case study, a cross-section of the average French citizen. She, along with everyone in her age cohort, experiences France's post-war boom, the radical 1960s and the backlash 70s and 80s, the age-conscious 90s, the end-of-history turn of the millennium.  Ernaux is most effective when writing about the period after 1968. At the time, she was approaching 30, and her writing seems to age with her. It becomes less ecstatic, less political, as if the narrator has better things to worry about than who's in power at the moment. She is much more interested in her personal life, seeing as she has a personal life now, and is thinking about writing a novel (this one).  The Years is perfect. It's poetic and informative and makes you want to live a good life. It's a must-read for anyone of any age, whether to look forward, to reminisce, or to get you out of a slump in life. Ernaux seems to have a nugget of advice for readers of all ages.","Logan"
"enjoyed this more as an informational read on the societal changes in france from the '40s to the early '00s. the way the author weaves through the personal and political was done so seamlessly and this style makes so much sense for this everywoman story she's trying to tell. also, time is a circle; we live in a society etc etc.","liz!"
"As the author writes in the book:   There is no "I" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography.   This is in fact a personal view on recent (from 1940 until 2008) French history, mixed with snippets from the author's own life, how she views and was affected by these historic events.  Consistent with the above quote, the author refers to herself as 'she' in the book.  Great fun, especially if you are reasonably familiar with recent French history. Otherwise, it might be boring or lead to numerous wikipedia searches.  See here for a more extensive review.","D"
"Annie Ernaux provides a record of the memories from her life using an “objective” third person perspective. She examines her memories in front of us and as her time overlaps with our own, we see our own memories in front of us. At the surface, The Years, is a story about Ernaux’s life growing up in France with descriptions of photos and memories starting from 1941 to the present day. But, on another level, it’s an examination of life in general. “What matters to her, on the contrary, is to seize this time that comprises her life on Earth at a given period, the time that has coursed through her, the world she has recorded merely by living.”","Corry"
"It's a really good history book, both for France history and of course Europe or western history as well. It has a peculiar way of writing, combining descriptions of fotos with society facts and private life.","Núria"
"Broad in scope, evocative in detail, The Years is the French writer Annie Ernaux’s dazzling collective autobiography, in which the cultural and social history of a generation is refracted through the lens of one woman’s experiences. It is a hugely impressive work, drawing on photographs, personal memories, cultural references, political history and social trends, threading together the perspectives of an individual (Ernaux), a generation (those who grew up in the aftermath of WW2) and a nation (France).  The underlying narrative running through the text is based on the trajectory of Ernaux’s life, from 1940, her birth year, to the mid-2000s, not long before the book was first published in French. Interestingly Ernaux uses ‘she’ rather than ‘I’ when conveying her own personal experiences, almost as if she is observing herself from a distance while writing the book. The collective experiences, however, are conveyed through the use of ‘we’, reflecting the ideas and perspectives of Ernaux’s generation and social class.  In fact, the question of how best to approach this style of memoir is one that Ernaux grapples with in the book. This is not the usual kind of autobiography, designed to convey an individual’s life history, story or analysis of the self. Instead, Ernaux envisages ‘a kind of woman’s destiny’, a text that will portray the passage of time, both individually and collectively – the blending of the personal with the universal referred to above.  She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of the generation. (p. 169)  By applying this approach to The Years, Ernaux recognises that our lives and experiences are influenced by the broader political, social and cultural environments in which we find ourselves. Moreover, our personal values and beliefs are reflected in our stances on these external dynamics, highlighting the relationship between the internal and external.  Over the course of the book, Ernaux focuses on key timepoints in her life: birth, childhood, adolescence, a move to college, early marriage and motherhood, the separation and divorce from her husband at forty, her relationship with a much younger lover at the age of fifty-seven. Each of these snapshots in time is introduced through the description of a photograph or a video clip. It’s an engaging way to open each section, cleverly blending imagery with glimpses of the author’s personal experiences and inner thoughts. In the photo described here, Ernaux – who is nineteen at this point – is posing with her college classmates, the philosophy class at the Rouen Lycée.  She is in the second row, third from the left. It is difficult to see in her the girl with the provocative pose from the previous photo, taken scarcely two years earlier. She wears glasses again, and a ponytail from which a lock of hair escapes at the neck. Frizzy bangs do nothing to soften her serious demeanour. Her face bears no sign of the events of the summer before, the boy’s invasion of her being, as semi-defloration evinced by the bloodstained underwear hidden between some books in her cupboard. No sign, either, of her actions and movements after the event: walking the streets after school in hope of seeing him; returning to the young ladies’ residence and weeping. Spending hours on an essay topic and understanding nothing. (pp. 73–74)  To read the rest of my review, please visit:  https://jacquiwine.wordpress.com/2021...","JacquiWine"
"After the first reading, I was slightly disappointed in this book. Expectations had been very (too?) high due to the many rave reviews. Yet I decided to give the book a second chance. I think the problem with this story is twofold. On the one hand, the form of the book, a collective autobiography in which personal impressions from the family sphere alternate with major world events, makes it difficult to really empathize with the book and the "main character". Moreover, it also lacks a real tension curve, indispensable in a fiction book. On the other hand, you also need to be well versed in French culture to understand the numerous references to French films, songs and books from, say, the 1950s. Unfortunately, this is not the case with me. Nevertheless, this nostalgic look back could also charm me. Its focus on memories and old photographs also makes you think back unconsciously to anecdotes from your own childhood and to relatives who are unfortunately no longer there.  ","Frederick"
"The Years is a slow burning racconto of the life of the author, since her earliest memories in countryside France to moving to Paris to turning seventy and becoming a grandmother.  A series of old photos mark the path through which Annie Ernaux frames her life within the collective, talking extensively about the ideas, activities and feelings that characterized each moment. Her life events function just as an example of this bigger picture in which we are rapidly submerged by the author.","Donnie"

"Annie Ernaux is a master. This is a mesmerizing read that is at once a history of our current era, a coming of age story for a young woman, and descriptive of how people change. One is struck by the weight of the march of globalization as American culture bears on the world Ernaux describes. Starts out very French, with family dinner talks of World War I battles in the Chemin Des Dames, Verdun, and World War II defeats, occupation, and starvation. Then by the end, American influence underscores her narrative with the weight of its power and culture, especially as she describes Vietnam, the moon landings, and the Gulf wars.  Ernaux uses a subtle and effective structure that enhances her time shifts that are hardly perceptible to the reader but conditions us nonetheless. Written by a master of her genre. ","Veronica Zerrer"
"Absolutely incredible and singular. I really enjoyed consuming this and approaching it like a puzzle, essentially. The act of reading while asking yourself, ‘What is this?’ Is actually really exciting. It’s not often you engage with something new to form. Or it isn’t for me, anyway.  Neither memoir or fiction, Ernaux attempts a time capsule encapsulating herself, representing, well, the culture of the time. Through thousands of notes and retreading old memory and sensations, she bottles the scent of recollection. She isn’t the subject; if anything, time and culture seem to be, in so far as they can be. They collide and bleed into one another. In so doing, illustrating the cycle of history and plucking the trends of culture that come back into fashion and recede, like sediment on a beach with the tide coming in.  It is fascinating that she uses the collective We for most things as well. Admitting a kind of complicity in the madness of crowds and sweeping energy of certain of notions taking everyone up, including her. Even if, at the time, she may not have thought and felt those things exactly, through the product of her memory, sifted through time, it appears that way regardless to her. That’s what happens when specificity cannot be obtained, I guess. There are the many small impressions and the inability to discern agency, so it is we and all of us. A collective responsibility that no one ever calls to account.  The tide of culture and nations continue to sew trends, probably courting longer memories; institutional ones. Or perhaps subservient to them like any other person. It does seem like the older people get, it becomes a ‘had to be there moment’. Except these moments bare a pretty startling resemblance to some that are occurring right now. Everything old is new again. And we just can’t seem to erect a structure that benefits from the collective intellect. Like a newborn, and their subsequent milestones, the collective memory is erased to make use of, or more likely, to protect itself from those ever damaging tides.","Fraser Simons"

"An exceptional memoir. The author uses old photographs to trigger the narrative which is in short paragraphs with no chapters throughout the book. Although I am about twenty years younger than the author many of her later memories resonated with me too particularly as she recalls her family growing up and the effect of events such as 9/11 and the internet. If you were to read this in your twenties it would be a joy to revisit this as you grow older.","Catherine Jeffrey"
"Definitely 5-star worthy! Brilliantly written (I have a literary bias towards French literature though hehe) and equally brilliantly translated! This seemingly short novel took me quite awhile to read as it heavily explores the historical sociopolitical issues related to France, for which I am unfamiliar with.  Indeed, this novel provides good insights on France’s socio-political situation including notable strikes and protests, change in educational and moral values, rise of feminism and attitude towards sex. All these events are intermingled within the autobiography of an unnamed narrator, who recollects her and the people in her life’s memories through a series of photograph depicting herself growing up from 1930s to 2001. These events have some parallels with other European countries and the USA, which probably makes it easier to digest by readers in such countries. For instance, mentions of famous Western music and artists (wooo The Beatles!), rise of consumerism and Western philosophies (like Camus) and literary works (Poems by Rimbaud... our narrator majored in English Lit haha).  What makes this novel brilliant is not only the fact that all those events are told in a concise manner, but the way the events are told through recollection of contrasting, mundane and banal events — dinner-table convos, Sunday afternoons TV time, clothing style, riding the Metro. Furthermore, the sensations were described so vividly that it transcends generation; of love and lust, of fear in the rise of media and technology, of revolution towards inequality, of the rebellions of adolescence and largely, the fleeting of memories through the marching of time. As we dive deep into the novel, we also get to learn the social and educational background of the narrator and the life she has led.  Also, love the use — and its overthinking, lol — of “We” instead of “I”, representing that these sensations were indeed of collective generational voices. The narrator herself said that this is intended to be a “collective autobiography”.  Again, to think that Annie Ernaux managed to squeeze all these in only 170 pages is sooo remarkable! Huge thank you to Alison Strayer for translating this really well too!  The book leaves us questioning: what memories make us? what memories are we going to make and what memories will we leave behind?  This is not a mere historical book, but also a memory hub of development and desires.","Rasy"
"very powerful I thought. It's pitched as a 'new Proust' which is nonsense, given it's only a couple of hours worth of reading, but the method, where a life is told as much by the news going by and the products consumed, I thought worked very well, in terms of 20th century subjectivity and all that…","Douglas Murphy"
"This was a tough one. I read this for the bookclub in my hometown. Most of the books we read there have been great reading experiences for me. But this one didn't really feel like the book for me. Partly because I might have made the mistake to read it in French. My level is ok, but this required a higher understanding. Not only in the language, but also in what was recalled I felt not French enough (being Belgian this is correct of course). And certainly too young. Perhaps it wasn't surprising that I came to appreciate the book somewhat better further on in the book.  Ernaux has written a sort of collective autobiography, which is definitely a tour de force, but if makes it rather impersonal as well of course. I guess I prefer a good story over a concise synthesis.","Klaas Roggeman"
"I love the moods. I feel like watching montage of a life after technicolor split into two parts: pre and post May '68 . Life, which was simpler - ads were ads, woman is a woman - moving towards radical revelations ("in order to think, speak, write, work, exist in another way, we felt we had nothing to lose by trying everything") and elusive mass consumptions. She tells more about society than it meant to be for an autobiography. I simply admire this style.","indah"

"Wow!  For something classified as auto-biography or memoir, this book left me completely cold. Reading it felt like stepping outside to walk Bobby around the block on a characteristically grey, windy, wet and bleak December day in England. Brrrrr!!!  Considering all the five star reviews here on Goodreads, I was expecting to finish it feeling, at least, a bit more warmed up.  The thing is, when I read non-fiction I like and need to be challenged and/or moved in some way to really enjoy it. I love it when an author (or someone else!) dares to question my beliefs and views but, unfortunately, nothing of what Annie Ernaux wrote got even close to doing so.  In my humble opinion, this was only a very summarised retelling of French History from the 1940s until the early 2000s from a feminist point of view. The few times some key moments of universal History were mentioned were purely with the aim of providing a chronological reference point to those reading the book, without which many might have struggled with its timeline!  Now, my friends, as most of you know by now I’m Portuguese and, even though I’ve studied French for several years in school, the ridiculous number of names, pop culture references and other cultural, social and political aspects intrinsically French related dropped within nearly every page did close to nothing for me, I’m afraid.  I can understand why this book might have turned into a literary phenomenon among readers in France, but honestly I can’t think of a single thing about it that hasn’t, more or less, been done before. I mean, I can see it as a good and lighter way for French students to get a bit more acquainted with the History of their own country, for example, but can’t, for the life of me, see a single reason for the author to think that a non French reader could possibly have any interest in getting to know the name of supermarket chains (ugh!) or what the nation’s favourite sweets were back in the 1970s.  Also, the first-person-plural point of view really kept me at arms length at all times and, because the author didn’t actually write a lot about her personal life apart from the fact that she (like everybody else) has always wanted loads of sex, I basically read this like the piece of historical writing that I think it is. In my brain, the whole book played out like an old black and white documentary instead of what could’ve been the colourful life story I was hoping for.  As I mentioned in my previous review, I don’t have what one might call an easy relationship with History and that, obviously, also played a big part in the way I reacted to this book.  I can’t say I’m very impressed with my introduction to Annie Ernaux but, thanks to the crazy number of great passages highlighted, am now curious enough to give her a second chance.  We lived in close proximity to shit. It made us laugh.  …we faced endless years of masturbation before making love permissibly in marriage. (…) Our lives were burdened with a secret that bracketed us with perverts, hysterics and whores.  The more immersed we were in work and family, said to be reality, the greater was our sense of unreality.  Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality.  Oh, and by the way, what were you doing on 11 September 2001?  Three stars, it is.  Highly recommended to all feminists and French lovers of Trivial Pursuit.","Pedro"
"An auto-fiction I found slightly less enjoyable for its content but surely more enjoyable for how it made me think and feel and wonder about how the first two decades of the 2000's might be written-remembered by someone writing in, say, 2080. That is assuming we, that "we" being human beings, actually get to that decade, something that in late December of 2021 looks increasingly unlikely, if not impossible. I love Ernaux's style of writing immensely, she is mostly vid of emotional flights or pensive psychological analyses, she merely tells you things as she observed them, all the while admitting freely that memory is dangerous and not always reliable, and hardly ever factual or exacting. I loved the French-ness of the details, thinking at times of what their American equivalent might have been. Also intriguing was her fascination with post-WWII American culture, which in many ways mirrored our interest in French culture of the period. The usual obsessions and extreme hyperbole of youth was humorous, especially as it has hardly changed these 70 years hence. Ernaux's intellectualism and talent shines throughout the narrative, and the interludes of family gatherings and simple descriptions of personal photographs were soft counterpoints to the talk of politics, sexual mores, and social upheaval. Not as intimate or personal (or minutely focused) as her shorter works, which held this reader off somewhat. Still, a brilliant piece of writing that might be remembered more for its thinly veiled critique of humanity than it will be for its poignantly rendered personal memories.","Jim"

"I bought this book after seeing an excellent two-handed play based on it. The play made brilliant use of simple props and contemporary music to tell the story of French society from WWII to the present. That's what the book does, but for me it was less satisfying.  Ernaux uses the arc of her own life as the skeleton of the story, but it's not an autobiography. She specifically uses "on" and "nous" instead of "je" to recount changes in French society and culture, along with global events. You need to have a good knowledge of modern French history as she alludes to significant political and historical events, generally without mentioning dates, and assumes you have heard of them. Similarly with music and films -- the play worked well for us because they played the music, so even if you weren't familiar with it, it evoked the era. And the book started to feel overlong and wordy, compared with the punchiness of a two-hour play that was never boring.  She is very good at capturing cultural moments in a paragraph though. Here she is on the French habit of rural vacations.  A défaut de tout quitter, travail et appartement, pour s'installer à la campagne, projet toujours remis mais qu'on était sûrs de réaliser un jour, les plus assoiffés de résurrection cherchaient pour les vacances des villages isolés sur des terres rudes, dédaignant les plages où l'on bronze idiot et la province natale, plate et "défigurée" par le progrès industriel. Ils créditaient en revanche les paysans pauvres des contrées arides, inchangées en apparence depuis des siècles, d'authenticité. Ceux qui voulaient faire l'Histoire n'admiraient rien tant que son effacement dans le retour des saisons et l'immuabilité des gestes -- et ils achetaient une vieille baraque à ces mêmes paysans pour une bouchée de pain.  I liked her description of the novelty of the centre commercial as well -- the bland light, the brightly lit windows, shops you can enter or leave as you wish, no door to push, no need to say "bonjour" or "au revoir".  Overall, an interesting approach, best enjoyed by boomers who grew up in France!  ","Veronica"
"I’m not sure if three stars might be too harsh here for The Years by Annie Ernaux but I think after reading other work by her, I was more interested in a more intimate experience. A while ago I was surprised to learn that I was born on Annie Ernaux’s September 1st birthday, 53 years after hers. Being a September 1st baby, I realized I shared a birthday with a day that lives in infamy as the day the Nazis invaded Poland to kick off the deadliest war in modern history. While growing up in the United States, I did not have as many relatives that were that impacted by World War 2 but it was still one of the first things I was taught to never forget.  This book kicks off shortly after the narrators birth in 1940 and lasts until Ernaux’s 66th year. In that small part of human history, the world has changed so much. I found myself being in awe at how many times throughout this book humanity thought that it was the end and no escaping whatever atrocity that happened whether in the natural world or by human behavior. As I read this in a once in a century pandemic while we are facing climate change, I find myself wondering if this is the end for us or will it be like all the other times we thought that the end was coming?  As I mentioned, I expected more of an intimate experience than what I got which is only a small disappointment. While I am reading the English translation by Alison L. Strayer, I am still able to connect to Ernaux’s writing and perspective. While it’s not necessarily what I expected, I still recommend this for a bit of perspective.","Briana"
"“at this time, no inventory could be made of the girl’s abstract knowledge”  later though, annie ernaux made an inventory. the result is buzzing earnest expression of a working class woman’s confrontation with the midcentury intellectual cool, wartime, modernity, generational disparity, motherhood and five decades of politics, trends, and technology. the novel sings the familiar tune of finding one’s identity in a seemingly abstract and meaningless world. without being trite, ernaux reminds her readers that we are not alone through palpable imagery and self expression feels like eye-contact.  I also especially enjoyed the English translation which was beautifully formed and felt well suited for the writing style and Franco-centric content.","Steffen"

"It's rare that I give five stars but this is quite a remarkable work. That it is so is partly due to the fact that it succeeds exquisitely as three different things - a social history of France through the second half of the twentieth century, a memoir of ageing, and a lament on the twin rise of techno-consumerism and political apathy (the latter due to the exhaustion, through constant disappointment, of the polis, a trend distracted from through recourse to the former).","D A Calf"
"I really love Annie Ernaux, especially her novels A Woman's Story and I Remain in Darkness, which, for me, is one of the best books on aging. Her style is highly original and distinctive, so "novels" is maybe not a good word to describe them. However, these two books, written in a simple but not simplistic style, offer the reader a wonderful insight into her characters - mostly her mother and the author's relationship with her - and I strongly recommend them (here is my review of "A Woman's Story" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).  Ernaux got great attention lately, and she deserves it - she is a superb author whose perception can make you stunned, she has the ability to touch her readers with the very few words, and above all to make them aware of the simple facts of life - how we are all defined by our social circumstances, personalities, etc....  And although The Years has been praised as her best book, i cannot for the life of me see why (some praise it as the book of the year?). This is a kind of socio-autobiography, some call it "impersonal autobiography" - the history of France and her own personal history and intertwined here, the style is good, very much Ernaux-like, and I understand her intentions, but overall I found it unemotional and empty. This text has not touched me one bit - I didn't care what would happen next, I found it tiresome, and I could not make myself finish the last 30 pages.  It is with some sadness that I write this - but maybe I expected too much. Maybe this is for an older generation who could have more feeling for the post-war France reality, but I don't think so. Maybe the author intended to 'cool' her text, make it less personal and more universal. But the lack of any emotion, any means of connecting and finding some sense in the narrative made it dull and uninteresting for me.","Ingeborg"

"Recommended by an old French friend who shuddered when I told her every boy I know seems to be reading Houellebecq.  This book is an astonishing work. Ernaux treats her life as a vessel through which to tell the story of cultural change in France, from 1940 - 2006. She chronicles big events, both historical and personal; the famous names and products used, but most importantly she writes of how economic and technological change shape consciousness. Ernaux, a working class rural girl who rose into the middle class, socially conscious but not a news addict, is the perfect narrator for such a story as her life itself seems to embody much of the trends of her lifetime.  If I were teaching a university course on nonfiction writing, I would assign this.","Amy"

"A personal account of European life from 1940's to the new millennium.  Annie Ernaux writes a personal and political history of European life from post-war era to the consumerism of today. And what a century it has been! From her childhood and teenage years when women's choices in life were limited, contraception was revolutionizing their life, education provided a way out from countryside, to a middle class family life.  The decades roll by and new materialism brings new gadgets and things that "must" be obtained in order to keep up in society. From time to time elections come, leadership of the country swings from left to right and progress takes two steps forward and one step backwards. Occasionally, in between raising children, correcting exams at school, and buying groceries, there are bursts of activism in the form of strikes and demonstrations.  Ernaux writes of her life in third person and I find that an excellent match to her style of memorizing. From time to time she looks at an old photo of herself and tries to remember who she has been and what has her thinking been like at the time. She demonstrates brilliantly how people and their thinking change during the course of life. Also she digs beneath the surface of the photos and links them to the personal and societal developments of the time they were taken.  Every turn of her life feels familiar and same developments can be seen in Finnish society. A touching personal history, highly recommended, and a well deserved Nobel prize 2022!","Elina"

"May 10th 2016, VivoCity mall, Singapore. The music being played was an eclectic mix of jazz and pop. Naughty Dog studios finally released their much anticipated fourth installment in the UNCHARTED franchise. I used to be a huge UNCHARTED fan back in the day. I asked dad whether I could get a copy. Dad said "You've already purchased two videogames in this trip.......well.......ok, you can have it!". I remember being over the moon as soon as I heard that. We walked into the store, I picked up a copy of the standard edition of the game and stood in the queue to bill, dad pointed out to something and asked me "What is that?". Dad was pointing to a copy of the "Special Edition" (an edition of the videogame that came with a steelbook cover and an artbook exclusive to that particular edition) of UNCHARTED 4. I told him "Dad, that is the special edition of the game, this edition won't be releasing in India due to a logistics decision by the publisher Sony". Dad immediately said "Buy the Special Edition!". I literally pinched myself to check whether the moment was real or not. That pinch did hurt but because of my elation due to what just transpired, pain gave way to joy!  We purchased a copy of the special edition and I immediately unboxed it, since I couldn't contain my excitement, but at the same time I was also paranoid about whether everything was in the case, the kind of paranoia that accompanies excitement. At first I was shocked to discover that the manual in the box and also the sheet that contained some digital unlockable items exclusive to the Special Edition were printed only in Cantonese. For a moment I was dejected by the fact that I bought an edition of a videogame I was waiting for ever since it was announced in a language that I can neither read, write or understand in general. Then, luckily my eyes fell at the back of the box where it was printed "Language of game: English". I was relieved! I quickly put everything back in the box and put the box in the suitcase we had purchased a day earlier.  Later in the evening, we boarded our flight back home. It was a turbulent flight. When we reached and when we are at the conveyor belt to receive our luggage, my heart immediately sank when I saw that the suitcase in which my copy of the videogame was had cracked open, literally like an eggshell! Throughout the taxi ride home, I was worried about one thing "Is my copy of UNCHARTED 4 ok?". We reached home, I immediately opened the suitcase and I was relieved by seeing that my copy of UNCHARTED 4 was ok! Out of excitement, I barely slept that night! Inspite of arriving home late last night, I woke up early in the morning, booted up my ps4, inserted the UNCHARTED 4 disc and I never realised when minutes turned into hours and hours turned into an entire day!  Its been years, I traded in my copy of UNCHARTED 4 for another game, the ps4 exhibited a fair bit of wear and tear and after running on its last legs for a few months, the ps4 is now defunct. To be honest, so is my interest in videogames anymore. Although, I wish I could change one thing about this, I wish the person who gifted me a copy of my most anticipated game ever was still around.  Now, this might sound like a pointless anecdote steeped in indulgent consumerism. Well, isn't that what the world is these days? "I'll get a coffee" being replaced with "I'll get a Starbucks". "That bag looks stunning!" being replaced by "That Louis Vuitton looks stunning!". Life in a way has become about tethering slivers of existence in a decrepit gossamer of consumerism. It eventually builds up to a cobweb, a cobweb that returns to dust, but now let's get that preorder because only limited copies are going to be in stock!  Annie Ernaux, in her stunning Booker International Shortlisted memoir THE YEARS, talks about the zeitgeist of France from 1966-2006, weaving a shape shifting narrative thread using anecdotes glimpsed from the lenses of pop-culture, socio-political news and ultimately, consumerism. In one of the most poignant sequences of the book, she talks about how the concept of the gradual yellowing of pages and creases gradually being formed on the cover is a concept of yesterday since everything is available at a mere click of a button ever since the advent of the bottomless pit, that is the internet!  Ernaux's prose seamlessly travels time and space and juxtaposes the personal with the socio-political in a manner so seamless that one is left in awe at the exquisite craftsmanship at display, the kind of craftsmanship that is so seamless that it almost feels invisible.  I read this book in what could be called a feverish pace in a mere span of two days, because of how absorbed I was by Ernaux's exquisite prose and by the time I flipped the last page, I immediately added Ernaux's entire bibliography in my wishlist! Well....in that regard Ernaux is indeed right, life and consumerism are rather seamlessly intertwined!","Nathan Drake"
"Annie Ernaux's "collective memoir" does live up to the hype.  I was worried that the stream of consciousness style of writing might be unpalatable for me. Instead it was a kind of meditative experience. The writing is brilliant. Lots and lots of passages to underline whilst nodding your head as you too recall how this-and-that happened and what we were thinking at the time.  A book I would highly recommend to anyone of my generation, and the one before, and the one after. You don't need to be French.  Also recommend this video: https://youtu.be/rnqAgmhxHBs of an interview with Annie Ernaux at the Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop in Paris. Some notes from that video:-  * The idea for the book dated back to 1985 when the thought came to her that eventually "all the images will disappear". But she had other writing and her job as a teacher, so she really started writing in 2000 when she retired. * The reason she didn't write in the 1st person was because she wanted to tell her story as part of her entire generation who had lived through extraordinary changes. Women's lives especially changed drastically in her lifetime. * The photos were used as a device to make the narrative more personal. * When she wrote about death and everything vanishing, she'd just recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. During time of her treatment she wrote a lot. * Book was completed in 2007: Thought then that the women's revolution had not happened. 'Feminist' was a bad word and that the world had gone backward. Today's younger generation, especially after the #metoo movement, has a different attitude to male privilege. * 1968 was a year of liberation and optimism. Looking to the future. (It is interesting to learn how important 1968 was for her generation in France). Today Annie feels the opposite about all levels of society. * 1981 was a resurrection of optimism - dashed by 1980s global triumph of neo-liberalism. * The book was not written as a 'judgement' but to describe how she and her generation felt. * She was very happy to have her books translated in English. The initiative to do so, came from her US publisher. * She got idea to be a writer when she was in England (1960?) working as an au-pair. * Doesn't want her books classified as either fiction or non-fiction, a problem for both publishers and booksellers!","Renate"
"Read it in Swedish but can't be bothered to add that version.  Though I expect quite a few things are lost - not so much in translation as in my lack of knowledge of modern French history - this was a glorious read. Took some time to get into, but then it was just a lovely, lovely, lyrical experience. I might not always agree with Ernaxu analysis but I do dearly wish she'd write more, explain my own time to me. Will read again, I'm sure.","Keeloca"

Ernaux believes that ‘By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.’ (Ernaux 2008 p190).

"3.5 stars  This book was beautiful and thought-provoking, but the style was not for me.  Les années was my first experience with Annie Ernaux. I admit I only just heard of her recently (though I am terrible at remembering author names), but I was immediately intrigued by her bibliography. After exploring reviews of her various works, I decided Les années would be the best place to start.  I really enjoyed the concept of a third person look at Ernaux’s life, as well as how she mixed in history, pop culture, and feminism. There was a lot to learn on each page and it flowed together in a way that was new and interesting. I am sure a native French person would get even more out of the references.  The only reason I’m not giving this a higher rating - and I do consider 3.5 stars quite good - is because I really do not care for the writing style. Ernaux’s writing is absolutely wonderful and evocative, but the narrative choice to have thoughts pop up one after the other in a seemingly endless line has never been my preference. So it is a personal mark against the book, rather than a critical one.  I would certainly suggest reading Les années. I am not sure if it holds up as well in translated versions, but it is worth a try, either way.","Elizabeth S"

I really love the sense of time passing that this book evokes. You REALLY see how different things get post 9/11, with the arrival of the Internet. Or in the 80's/90's, when it just becomes so easy to buy everything and anything - such a contrast to her childhood in rural 1940's France. And honestly, the most powerful section for me was the last 20%, when she is a grandmother, and she is just like... how did I get here? How did I become old? Just really emotional and effective. Reminded me of the movie Boyhood. Overall, a really fascinating approach to the story of a life. I want to read more of her work.","Professor Weasel"

"Poignant reflections on life and memory for the generation born around 1940. The ways Ernaux deploys her writing to mirror diverse speeds of life in different periods makes for an interesting experiment. The intersection between the personal and historical becomes more intense in the final third of the book, as Ernaux's character ages and life speeds up, for example. Some very interesting insights into the relationship between past and future give the short book at times a poetic quality. At other times however I'm left wanting more--more analysis, less surface observation.","Julie Greene"

"We Didn't Start The Fire, but instead of a 4 minute song, it's a 242 page book.  The best of the three Ernaux books I've read, but still didn't really grab me. I feel like Elena Ferrante does a much better job of portraying a generation in the Neapolitan Novels than Ernaux does here, where the whole generation is just reduced to a conformist left-wing academic "we". "We" read Simone de Beauvoir and "we" voted for Mitterand and so on. There's no conflict anywhere in the book, which reminded me of Richard Linklaters charming space-age memoir Apollo 9½, but here the charm and the humor are missing as well. Also dislike how Ernaux seemingly ends all her books by explaining her process and her stylistic choices.","Erik"

"Wow. This is a book full of great sentences that I want to write down so I can remember them. The book itself is about memories, collective memories, and generations and aging. I kind of want to start reading it again, right after I finished it. Maybe it was just right for me now, in the middle of my life (one can hope), it resonates with me because I think about generations and my place in history, and the purpose of the photos I take in a sort of family history. This is not a personal biography, it is more collective, but it always feels intimate and personal.  The book is French, and the author relates a lot to French history and society. In the beginning this was difficult for me, because I don’t have that kind of knowledge about France. But after a few pages, it didn’t matter, because the topics are universal.  I have a feeling this book will stay with me for some time, and I highly recommend it!","Nina Rundgren"

"I read this novel right before Annie Ernaux was awarded with the Noble Prize, starting it for the second time, after having giving up a first time. Sadly, this novel was not for me. While this autobiography is very cleverly structured, it baffles me to see all the five-star reviews, as I think the text would only need interesting to the French.  To me, the whole book felt like a drawn-out conversation with a bourgeois Frenchman who wants to show how humanitarian he or she is and how everything he or she does is, in fact, done in solidarity with lower-class people. Showing solidarity is obviously not the problem, but rather the fact that this kind of people emphasize it so much, as if they want to get a medal for it.  Stylistically, I initially liked the vignettes about photographs Ernaux describes, but I quickly got tired of the fact that she simply swaps out "je" for "nous" to make her experiences universal. The meta chapter at the end (about writing this novel) was downright cheesy.","Lotte"
"In her amazing book, Annie Ernaux presents a panorama of her life, the life of her family and of her generation in France since the 1940s. As I was reading her rich account, I was reflecting on my own life and on how much is happening around us and affecting us to a greater or lesser degree; we notice, we attempt to change our life, seek new directions, find meaning. We strive. As we approach the end of our life, Ernaux declares her urge to save her memories of the events that marked her and her generation. But why this urge? very few of us are privileged enough to have lives of interest to others, even to our own families. Still, there is a deep need to defeat time. So, in an attempt to conquer time Ernaux writes her memoir, her unusual auto-biography, and in doing so offers us too solace as we face oblivion.","Anna"
"Even if it refers so much to France's recent history, this book had much to offer to me. I loved her observations, that not only brought me back in time, reminiscing about my own life past & experiences (for there is enough reference to figures and events that you and me and everyone knows about); it gave also insight into what actually is below these currents of modern history, though she merely suggests it instead of naming it. The form she chose, that of collective autobiography, is intensely original, and wonderfully shaped, in vivid, pictorial, sensual sentences. I will definitely reread this book. She is an observator with visionary gifts. Her tone is that of alienation, she feels distant to her time whilst being so much part of it, whilst participating so greedily in it; it is how I often feel myself. A spectator. SHE is a spectator in a spectacular way, definitely. She not only describes the world, she intensely transmits a feeling of being and not being part of the world. In this text you see that just in perceptiveness lies the most personal expression.","Peter Zomer"

"Those who follow my blog know that I am a huge Annie Ernaux fan. I just love the way her books include certain details of her life and if one reads them back to back, one gets a full-ish biography. Saying that The Years is different from her previous books.  First of all the structure is less like a flowing narrative and more like a scrapbook of memories. Here Ernaux takes a look at pictures, adverts and articles and documents the culture at the time and how it affected her. Thus we get a whole history of France dating from the 40’s all the way to 2006. De Gaulle, the urbanisation of France, The Algerian conflict, The rise of Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy, The Gulf War, France’s 1998 Euro cup win, 9/11, mobile phones and much more are mentioned.  What we gain out of this is how personal history is affected by what goes on in the world. We also see how France has changed, from a mostly rural society, from a liberal one to an ultra modern and cosmopolitan one. Annie Ernaux has experienced all of these and, as stated, they did change her.  Despite the patchwork structure, The Years is readable and yet reveals it’s layers as one goes along: is it historical? a feminist text? a memoir? The truth is that it is all of these.  Although the book is an atypical Ernaux, I will say that it is definitely her strongest one to date. I felt like I was taken on a journey on, mostly, unknown territory. This is not Ernaux’s most personal book but it is her most ambitious and far reaching one.","Robert"
"Wonderful, striking, fresh structure for a memoir...her memories are framed as collective memories of a generation (and as history). I will read this again and again.  Oh how timely, as she just won the Nobel prize for literature!!","Cara"
"As she reaches the end of The Years, Ernaux reflects on the form that the text has taken: "'a palimpsest sensation'...a potential instrument of knowledge that is not only for herself, but general, almost scientific, though a knowledge of what, she doesn't know." She hopes to record "an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation." Sometimes, the generalization of her specific experience (what movie she saw on a particular day, or what brand of shampoo she buys later in life) into something greater is the trouble; other times, "she seems to melt into an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at a time."  Ernaux writes the entirety of The Years in the first-person plural. Sometimes it does not make immediate sense to do so, but usually this facilitates a delve into the unconsciousness of society & the body politic unlike anywhere else in literature. She is able to pause a moment that might appear to be empty, dead time, extend it, and uncover its collective emotional content, so that we understand the nuances of the emptiness between revolutions.  Just as Ernaux energizes the difference between singular and plural, she energizes the possibilities of listing by introducing her lists with aphorisms like "The increasingly rapid arrival of new things drove the past away" (83) before cataloguing the explosion of home appliances, superstores, complex financial instruments, and portable technology, each item deepening the meaning of the original aphorism.  Modernity presents her with a challenge: "We did not age. The things around us did not last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn't have time to associate them with moments of existence." As Ernaux feels the years vanish before her she can uncover the death drive in the new all around her.  Ernaux is so driven to reconcile individual sensation with collective experience, memory, and consciousness that she expands, without pretension, the possibilities of writing to achieve just that.","Michael"
"A really interesting effort to make a kind of collective autobiography, a story of an individual mostly only in so far as constituted by the times -- often a "we" not an "I," or sometimes a "she" in a semi-impersonal analysis of photos and films.

"Rating: 4.5  I chose this book on a whim after flipping through the prefacing pages, and I'm glad my impulse purchase was duly rewarded because this was a great read. I hadn't heard of Annie Ernaux before picking this up and thought it was interesting based on the blurb and some choice pages alone. Touted as 'a Remembrance of Things Past for our age of media domination and consumerism', Ernaux's memoir is written in vignettes of her observations throughout several decades.  Although this memoir covers the 1940s to the early 21st century, Ernaux's observations are relatable even to those who have not gone through more turbulent times and on a different continent. In fact, it was interesting to see how the past often repeats itself and how human beings don't really learn all that much despite knowing this very fact. There were several incidences referenced in this memoir that is worth looking up if you'd like a deeper understanding of how their lives have been formed during this time (i.e. what happened in Dien Bien Phu, the Paris massacre of 1961). These incidents further reinforce the phrase 'the more things change, the more they stay the same', considering our current affairs.  What I loved most about this memoir is how unflinching and self-critical Ernaux was when she wrote this memoir. It's hard to admit our respective weaknesses, much less admit our faults, yet Ernaux did it time and time again when talking about her fellow countrymen's collective thinking and culture on the more controversial topics she raised in this memoir (e.g. internalized racism, the French's sense of superiority over their neighbors or colonized counterpart, the debate on the purity of consumerism and so on).  Ultimately, Ernaux herself mentioned that this memoir 'will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self'. It's self-examination and recollections at its best, and one that I relished.","Nadirah"
"this woman>>","martina&#x1fad0;"
"On the back cover of my version of this book it is described as a 'nouvelle forme d'autobiographie, impersonnelle et collective', a description I think suits it very well. Although the author refers back to family photos quite frequently, the whole book is more a potted history of the period from the end of WWII up to Sarkozy and Clearstream than a standard autobiography. Being somewhat ancient myself, it brought back a lot of memories but I am not sure to what extent it might appeal to a much younger reader who has not experienced the events to which Annie Ernaux is referring, especially as one does not make the acquaintance of the author herself to any great extent.","Ivy-Mabel Fling"
"If you've lived your life in France throughout the last 7 decades you probably find this book a lot better than I did. Ernaux has written her biography in a form she sure is proud of, as it mixes third-person observations of a (i.e. her) life with the collective "we" representing a certain time. Unfortunately large parts of the book are listings. First, an observation of a feeling followed by numerous objects/memories that materialized the feeling. Sometimes the listing is so long that you forget what they were suppose to emphasize. That 70% of the things listed is of French origin (obviously, since Ernaux grew up in France) makes it almost unbearable. Mentioning French authors, movies, actors, politicians, public figures, events and places dating back to the 40'ies makes it REALLY hard for a foreign person (born in the 90'ies) to connect with the content! Especially when the life depicted has no measures of extraordinaire.  That be said, I did actually gain something important from this book. It made me realize that the the topics of the passionate conversations I have in my life, spawned from frustration, anger or a feeling of unfairness, is not unique for my time. That I give far too little credit or thought to the complexities (and lengths) of my parents' and grandparents' lives, as if a year in their 20'ies counts less than the previous year in mine. That their collective demand for change was probably as passionate as what I demand today when it comes to equal rights. I didn't realize that, maybe because it's just nature's law that you reach a age where you simply don't understand the new demands of the youth because you see them in contrast to your own (to some the right to safe sex may seem more essential than the right to consensual sex. But should we stop demanding just because we've improved over time?). I'll keep those realisations with me, but it's highly unlikely I'll ever read another book from Ernaux.","Simone Vestergaard"

"“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.”","Hagai Palevsky"
"A must-read again. I mistakenly raced through it. A wonderfully collective form of memory, that while particular to Ernaux and to France, never feels “foreign.” ","Nancy"
"This is an autobiography of the authors life from the age of a young girl in post war France, to an established author and for the first time in charge of her own sexuality at the end of the 20th century. But what makes this book so special is that it is also a a testament, or a letter, to her generation. The book therefore becomes a biography of an entire birth cohort, and eventhough I am much younger, I really enjoyed reading about it.  Who will write the testament to my generation? Is there ever anyone who will write a biography like this as well as Ernaux? This is a book for readers who love reading. Absolutely personal and universal at the same time. Political and poetic.  Annie Ernaux was the winner of the Nobel prize in Literature this year. If you are interested in her works, this book will not disappoint.","Anna Hasselqvist"
"Like a lot of people, I rushed to pick this one up after the a-little-bit-surprising selection of Annie Ernaux for this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature.  And, while I do like and admire this, I remain surprised by that selection.  To be fair, this is a striking and often successful prose experiment. I’m tempted to call it a first-person-plural history of the last six decades, or maybe ‘history filtered through the consciousness of the crowd.’ (But not crowd as Don DeLillo explores the notion…in work that seems to me more deserving of the Nobel.)  Ernaux traces what may be her life – using most often a plural narrator and, occasionally, a third-person singular – as it’s inflected by the various political and technological events she has experienced. We never quite see “her,” but we experience a consciousness growing and responding to a changing world.  It is – and I want to be fair – pretty cool.  At the beginning, and again briefly at the end, Ernaux defines history as memory. And then she defines memory as detail.  For a time, I feared I was going to find her in the Karl Ove Knausgard or David Foster Wallace school of throw-it-all-on-the-page, a literary movement that troubles me for – as I experience it – drowning us in detail and offloading the work of constructing a true narrative from the author to the reader. (Elena Ferrante does some of that, too, but I admire her work more than those others. And, again, she strikes me as a more likely Nobel winner, especially if the committee wanted to acknowledge a European woman writing about her experiences growing up with the weight of the memories of World War II.)  As it turns out, though, Ernaux is after something I find more interesting. In a bit like an updated form of the Robbe-Grillet “new novel,” she’s pushing the limits for how we can evacuate personality from her narrative. There’s still a presence, a residue, but it’s a distant one. I’ve read interviews where Ernaux explains it. Her former self (selves) is somewhere between the person she is and a fictional character. She questions – fascinatingly – some of the premises of memoir, with the result that we have a book that doesn’t fall into easy categories of fiction or nonfiction.  So, as I say, I admire this a lot, and I’d be open to reading another of her works.  For now, though, I can’t help feeling a bit disappointed at the near total absence of traditional narrative. Things happen here, but, since they don’t happen to anyone who comes into focus as a character, there’s no one for them to happen to. This is a people’s history rather than the history of a person.  And it seems to me that drama ultimately matters because of the person who experiences it.  In the hands of a lesser writer, this might have been a Wikipedia entry explaining certain cultural trends or the French reaction to one or another political event. Given what I do acknowledge as her real skill, it’s a fascinating experiment.  Still, I miss story in this. I believe in character even if, in a way more convincing than I’d have guessed possible, Ernaux shows us a fiction (or memoir) that challenges the possibility of encountering a real person on the page. ","Joe Kraus"
"Different type of book and a unique writing style. It’s poetic and the language is flowing easily. However, it is heavy reading; because the book is not a story (it’s more like a historical narrative from around 1910) I wish I could read this book in its language of origin. Annie Ernaux deserves Nobel Prize. ","Yahya Alshukri"
"This book is so well written and an amazing amalgamation of a generation which is almost the same as my own. I found the parallels between her time growing up in France and my own in the US fascinating. At the same time, I was left feeling like life is essentially meaningless and that was depressing. Perhaps because she never talks about love whether between romantic partners or even between a mother and her child which I imagine as giving value to my life. And her creativity of writing her life story is always “something to do someday”. Maybe creativity and love are the only small gifts we leave from our lives.","Elizabeth G"
"Formally unusual (memoir-style novel in the collective first- and third-person) and an interesting lens on post-WWII France, but shapeless and plotless. It's the literary equivalent of one of those colorized and image-stabilized historical videos on YouTube: fun and interesting to watch, but not particularly artful or insightful.","Ted"
"Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it’s slipping by, but at the same time “progress” has landed us in a place we no longer recognize. New York Times     I appreciated the history lesson and the honesty in this memoir. Many such essay collections become a laundry list of complaints but this memoir was diverse in topic and nuanced in explanation. It is a cruel irony that the bottle sitting by the sink that bleaches your hair to the shade of blond you wanted so badly is brought to you by the same corporations that you complain about pushing the latest toasters.","cycads and ferns"
"We are reading Annie Ernaux and we are very delighted. 'The Year's' promises an authorship that will enjoy us with more books with similar high class. We think it must be their best choice since Jose Saramago, in purely egoistic terms. We like it, that we understand, become engaged, enjoyed and feel as a part of even the literary world.    We sometimes have felt all stupid again, from choices we couldn't even understand. We felt it was too prudish at times. An ill smelling snobbery pricing literature for a tiny group of writers with a symbolism of no general availability for other cultures. We felt ashamed when Sweden, again, was priced. We felt cheated when our favourites never got it. They hate predictability, which is something we still, also, like about them. We don't like when they make statements though. Giving a brilliant singer, writing good local journalism this price we realise they are being unaware of biases and the effects on music to dope lyrics with qualities of moment. You don't have to keep the words moving with thinking, since music makes them seem alive in a not very magical way.   But only a week with the francophile choice of Annie Ernaux we are already very delighted. We got ourselves an author not unknown to focus on. We think of Ali Smith reading and are filled with joy, although it's less general (arguably), and packed with references only referring to France. We long to read another book by her, while still reading the first one. We don't forgive this noble institution but we know that people in power through all ages have tremendous collective disabilities in mentalisation. We are ourselves expressing views on topics without that much knowledge on them, or how they will be understood by others. And we are only one.","Anders Demitz-Helin"
"For a book that is pretty much an endless list of summarized French (and occasionally World) history, this just feels so empty. It’s sprawling time-wise for a memoir, but doesn’t go deep into anything mentioned. It’s basically a timeline of a woman’s life from 1941-2006 punctuated by both historical events and random life shit specific to Ernaux.  The parts about growing up as a French girl of her socio-economic status in the 40s-50s, and then experiencing the country transition to a more equal place for women had me interested. If this had a consistent feminist lens I imagine I would have enjoyed it more, but it really seems to lose its focus in the second 1/2, last 1/3rd especially, and seems to get more disjointed.  I’m sorry but I’d rather just read a history book and get a complete picture. To me, writing a book centered on memory and the passage of time is a worn-out concept. At least it’s a woman that’s doing it this time.  Also I don’t like her prose style.","Amelia"
"Genius memoir written in third person from post-WW2 to present. Ernaux wrote frequently of her changing personal values throughout life with hard diamond edges. She also kept a thread of global historical moments throughout and some mainly French history involving women's rights and the deaths of iconic philosophers.","Liv Ross"
"I can totally see why she won the Nobel price. Her work is so beautiful and her way of writing is like nothing I’ve read before. It’s purely observational without being boring, poetic without a rhythm and connected without a plot. I can also totally see why one would not like it. It’s easy to lose track or interest if you don’t personally like her style. Overall really good and I hope to read more from her. I can only imagine how beautiful the original is:)","Teodora"
"A social history of a self, where the self is its history and so it is actually dissolved in the social. Not that my opinion matters, but I think Annie Ernaux is basically right about everything.  If I was in charge of a planned economy, I would have a million people writing versions of this book every couple years.","T"
"A must-read account of the European experience in the 20th century. She captures beautifully the personal, the female and the collective experience. Utterly honest and compelling. I bought this edition several years ago at Shakespeare & Co in Paris and was reminded of it when Ernaux won the Nobel Prize this year.","Kate"

"*** Possible Spoilers ***  I quite liked this book although it wasn't what I expected. It was classified under History and, to some extent, it is, but it is a combination of history from 1940 through to the present and a memoir of Annie Ernaux during that time period. Originally in French, I listened to an audio version translated into English. Some phrases were left untranslated. As a result, I couldn't understand them all and missed a few things.  As a history it's okay but works better as a memoir. The author mentions various aspects of the past and then goes on to explain how they related to her and made her feel. In addition, she sometimes linked past with future events so at time the chronology was a little confusing. She might be discussing something from the early seventies and then make reference to an event in the eighties. She would get back to the seventies but it sometimes required a mental leap on the part of the reader to know where she was.  Because Ms. Ernaux lived - and possibly still lives - in France, the time period is presented from a French perspective. For North American readers this can be a little baffling. She names any number of politicians, some of whom were presidents, I'd never heard of. Likewise she skimmed quickly over things which were milestone events in North America. I don't think she devoted more that a paragraph, perhaps only a sentence to the assassination of J. F. Kennedy but goes on an on about a riot which occurred in 1968. I vaguely remember news reports of rioting in Paris but it never seemed more than a blip on the radar whereas for the author it was major and she returns to it time and time again. Still there are enough overlapping incidents to remind the North American reader of the period.  Much of the book deals with how the author felt about events, trends, and people - mostly politicians - which impinged on her life. Because her politics were on the left certain things outraged her which I didn't consider at all troubling, but, political views aside, she was never preachy.  Younger North American readers may find this book puzzling and perhaps too slow to bother with. Older readers, I think, will enjoy it. There are better resources for pure history but she captures both an essence of the time and a feeling for how the years have flown.  ","Doug Lewars"
"Annie Erno, the literary Nobel of this year and the case when you feel grateful to academics: if it were not for their choice, I would not have recognized this writer and this book. The peculiarity of Erno the writer is the small volume of works, she is not one of those who pack the treasures of her wisdom in folios. A book that you spend an evening on has a better chance of being read than a thick novel.  "Years" will take about as much time and are written in such a way that reading is really like watching a social network feed: you squander, immerse yourself in the text as in a video, finding yourself among things, objects, names, ideas, prejudices, emotions, feelings, duties, privileges of one piece of reality. You scroll further and the picture around completely changes. Erno is able to fill a small volume of a separate fragment with meaningful content as tightly as possible, connecting the history of progress, politics, culture with the stages of a woman's life.  A world in which the narrator occupies no less and no more space than everything else. The equivalence of man and history.  Женщина и утраченное время Вся наша взрослая жизнь прошла при власти, которая не имела к нам никакого отношения, и двадцать три года казались единой безнадежной текучей массой, откуда не вышло ничего удачного в смысле политики. Мы ощущали такую досаду, словно у нас украли часть юности. Анни Эрно, литературный Нобель нынешнего года и тот случай, когда к академикам испытываешь благодарность: если бы не их выбор, не узнала бы этой писательницы и этой книги. Одна из особенностей Эрно-писателя малый объем произведений, она не из тех, кто пакует сокровища своей мудрости в тысячестраничные кирпичи. В современности все больше тяготеюще к скроллингу и клиповости, у книги, на которую потратишь вечер, больше шансов быть прочитанной, чем у толстого романа.  "Годы" возьмут примерно столько по времени и написаны так, что чтение, вправду, похоже на просмотр ленты соцсети: проматываешь, погружаешься в текст как в ролик, оказываясь среди вещей, предметов, имен, идей, предрассудков, эмоций, чувств, обязанностей, привилегий одного кусочка реальности. Проматываешь дальше и картина вокруг полностью меняется. Малый объем отдельного фрагмента Эрно умеет максимально плотно наполнить значимым содержанием, соединяя историю прогресса, политику, культуру с этапами жизни женщины.  Книга выстроена в тесной привязке к визуальному ряду, каждый этап предваряет описание фотографии из семейного архива: маленькая девочка, подросток, девушка, юная женщина, молодая жена и мать, мама сыновей подростков, профессионал на грани развода, свободная женщина в новом мучительном романе, синдром опустевшего гнезда, бабушка и опять деструктивные отношения с мужчиной, разрыв и новые отношения, на сей раз конструктивные. Об этом фоном. это не заслоняет собой мира и того, что в нем происходит.  Собственно история в ее предметном наполнении и есть содержание. Вторая половина XX и первое десятилетие XXI века, промежуток времени от примерно 1946 года. когда Анни начинает осознавать себя более-менее внятно, до 2008, в котором книга вышла в свет. Обычная жизнь девочки из нижнего слоя среднего класса, у родителей была своя небольшая торговля в маленьком городке. Вот так одевались, это ели в повседневной жизни, то на праздник, такие разговоры велись в застольях, такие песни пели, такие присказки были, этим восхищались, то презирали и осуждали, так обращались с детьми, так лечились.  Время сдвигается, на следующем фото уже не милая пухлая детка, а девочка. которая хочет быть похожей на кинозвезду и безотчетно копирует позу с обложки журнала. Так общались в школе, четкое разделение класса на три не пересекающихся подмножества: богачки, изгои, середняки. Интересно. что об аспекте классово-кланового разделения с самого раннего этапа взросления практически никто не говорит как Эрно. У большинства тех, кто пишет о школе класс нечто монолитное. У нее четко: были девочки, которые вне школы не взглянули бы на тебя, были такие, которых ты сама не сочла бы достойными разговора. И внезапным узнаванием окатывает: на самом деле так, в любой группе из трех десятков человек общаешься максимум с десятью.  Время идет, девочка взрослеет, вот групповое фото старших школьниц, по спокойной сдержанности героини нипочем не догадаешься, что больше всего на свете ее беспокоит задержка месячных. Дальше: Париж, студентка, роман с будущим мужем, технический прогресс все настойчивее вторгается в повседневность, пылесос, холодильник с морозильной камерой, мечты о малолитражке. Первенец, ежедневные заботы о семье, и вот уже родители с их советами о ребенке и приемах экономии не кажутся такими безнадежно отсталыми.  Политические события, не затрагивая напрямую, не воспринимаются по-настоящему значимыми. Вот война за независимость в Алжире, поди-разбери что там реально происходит. Надо бы скорее подавить бандитов, которые все затеяли. Внезапно Алжир уже не наш, и "черноногие" (французские колонисты) возвращаются, а с ними и за ними волна мигрантов-арабов, лояльных прежнему правительству, которым при новой власти грозит смерть. Странно, но они похоже готовы делать самую непрестижную низкооплачиваемую работу - пусть будут.  А потом май 68-го, героине в это время уже к тридцати,семья, работа, двое детей, мечта об отпуске в Испании (там все дешевле). Что? Какие студенческие волнения? После, когда волна докатывается до их провинции, охватывает всю страну - да, мы тоже не выйдем на работу. И вот этот моме��т: после будут вспоминать май 68 так, словно сами были на баррикадах, временная дистанция искажает восприятия, но на самом деле было вот так.  Так со всем: слушали, читали то и то, ездили отдыхать ��уда, покупали в семью это. Вот таким прорывом оказался телевизор, давший зрелища всем членам семьи и вернувший мужчин в дом. А так воспринимали политиков: де Голль, Помпиду, Ширак, ��оскар дЭстен, Митерран, Саркози. Индокитай, Мао, Карибский кризис (красавец Кеннеди-мужлан Хрущев), войну во Вьетнаме, Чили, Перестройку, площадь Тяньаньмэнь, Чернобыль, 11 сентября, компьютер, мобильный телефон, интернет.  До предела насыщенный, видимый, слышимый, осязаемый предметный мир, в котором рассказчица занимает не меньше, и не больше места, чем все остальное. Равнозначность человека и истории, органичная встроенность женщины в реальность, которая может казаться равнодушной и враждебной, но их принадлежность друг другу несомненна.","Майя Ставитская"
"Wow. Just wow. Ernaux provides a survey of French life from her birth in 1940 to 2005 (the book was published in 2006). It’s both deeply intimate and autobiographical, as well as generational, eschewing the use of “I” and opting instead for the more sweeping chorus of “we,” only occasionally moving to “she” when speaking directly of herself. This is a dazzling, thoughtful observation of the monumental changes to daily life ushered in by those decades, as well as the political and social upheavals, even the pop culture references of TV programs, ad campaigns, toys, games, candies, etc, etc. The years take her from a working class upbringing in Normandy, when a woman’s only choices involved marriage and motherhood, through her generation’s mass pairing off and procreation—born a decade too early to truly partake of the Swinging Sixties and the political paroxysms of 1968. And so on through the decades. It’s not simply a catalogue of events but a lucid account of mindsets and attitudes, a truly sociological document. I am in awe of the accomplishment and heartily concur with the Nobel Prize committee. Mon dieu!","Deborah"
"Interesting how parallel things ran in the last 70 years between the US and France. Lots of memories but also a lot of names I never heard of.","Ray-The-Pilot"
"I would describe this as an observational reminiscence but with a detachment that is objective and without remorse.  Annie Ernaux reflects upon her life from 1941 to 2006 and leaves nothing untouched. Her writing is beautiful describing memories of the past: dialects, passions, traditions, family, children, education, sex.  Using descriptions of photos, she places herself in the scene but also above it thus is able to commentate on her thoughts and feelings.  Fascinating.","Lee McKerracher"
"4.5. A must-read if you are (like me) getting to the age where you start thinking about "what it all means". It will be especially enjoyable if you follow French history/culture as there are so many references sprinkled throughout the text. Plan for a few tears at the end.","Cory"
"Deeply felt.","Rajeev Pillai"
"You know when you read a book and you think, "I wish I would have written this." This is one of those books. In just 240 pages, you experience 1940 through 2006 in one woman's life. Although helpful to read/understand some French, there are lots of footnotes to help you navigate the French references. Written in the "je collectif" style, all events happen to "we." I didn't find this distracting. The other amazing thing that Ernaux is able to do is how she handles time and the passage of it. I don't always like the writing of those who win the Nobel Prize for Literature, but that is not the case with this. I look forward to reading as much of her writing as I can.","Suzette"
"A wonderful autobiography interwoven with a chronicle of life events and experiences we have in common. Few novels get a reader to examine, recall, relive their personal experiences in tandem with an author. It was an incredible journey for her and me.  "Save something, from the time where we will never be again."","KLacroix"
"The third-person autobiography, while reminiscent of another Nobel Prize winner, is different from Coetzee's in that it is not used exclusively autobiographically. Sometimes we are not sure if the 'she' is Ms Ernaux or a more generalised she. Sometimes this is made explicit (use of 'we'). It was fascinating to be in France and read about French history (of the second half of the last century into this one) in such a manner. Learning later that Ms Ernaux' unmitigated championing of all things left and far-left has led her to quite some trouble is interesting, too, but will not mar the wonderful reading experience this novel-cum-diary-in-retrospect offered.","Roland"
"Last year I had not heard of Annie Ernaux. Then I began to manage a new bookshop and we got in a range of books from independent publishers. I noticed that Fitzcarraldo seemed to be especially good and have a very high reputation. I had never read any of their books, despite having Second Hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich on my book shelves for years (I still haven't read it yet). Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk is one of our bestselling books, so I read that to see what the fuss was all about, and thought it was great. We were asked to host an event with Joshua Cohen for his book The Netenyahus, so we did, and I thought that novel was great, and it went on to win the Pulitzer Prize the next year. Then they asked if we would host an event for Daisy Hildyard for Emergency, so we did, and I thought it was another excellent novel. But we have more books by Annie Ernaux from Fitzcarraldo then any other writer, and she seems to have a fanbase that consists mostly of intelligent young women, so I picked up The Years a couple of months ago. Just as I decided it was time to read it Ernaux won the Nobel Prize.  This is the best Fitzcarraldo book I have read yet, and I think it's one of the best books of the 21st Century so far. It is a marvellous book, blending together autobiography, history and sociology in a very literary style. Ernaux reveals and crafts the sweep of her life, from being born into a relatively poor provincial family during WW2, through the social, political and material transformations that took place in French society in the decades that follow as she experiences the youth rebellion of the 50' and 60's, ascends into the bourgeoise, becomes a teacher, a wife and mother, experiences the revolutionary moment of May 68, and the political disappointment and cynicism that follows in the subsequent decades.  I cannot do the book justice with this description. I think it is one of the essential books of the 21st century. I can't think of a British writer operating at this level. And we should be very thankful to Fitzcarraldo for bringing the best literature in the world into being, and into English. ","Darran Mclaughlin"
"The best book I've read bringing back memories of my life and the history of the world. Although I am almost 20 years younger than the author, I remember some of the world's history she mentions names cascade back like Solzhenitsyn (whom my brother resembled on his return from France after loosing his hair and growing a beard his Junior year abroad), Boris Yeltsin, and Lech Walesa (remind me to look them up as I have little true knowledge of them other than names repeated interminably on the news). Do I know anything of the war in Algers, much less the French involvement? But yet the book is amazing in its one, we, and us perspective making you feel you are there. I always thought a book could be written using common phases and here she has done it without a hint of the trite! Of course, she won the Nobel prize, how could she not with this! Where has she been all my life. She encourages one to write...starting now! A gift of a book from one who must have been an amazing teacher.","Eneubig"

"I love it when a writer I haven't read before gets awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and it prompts me to explore their work. I've rarely been disappointed, and that holds true for Ernaux's work. This one was acclaimed a few years back and it's a really interesting attempt at a kind of collective autobiography, where Ernaux uses the collective "we" rather than "I" or describes herself (often via a photo) in the third person. She captures the flavour of France across her lifespan, including the trivial minutiae, which is part of the point but at times felt slightly tiresome. Overall, though, I thought this was very impressive.","Blair"

"Congratulations to Annie Ernaux for being the 2022 awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature!  Having read several of her shorter books this year, just by chance, I now can suggest that the first book you should read by Annie Ernaux should maybe be A Frozen Woman, which gives the broader context of one of her over all purposes: What does it mean to have been a girl and woman in the fifties and sixties in Paris? In that book she mainly tells her own story, from early girlhood through an early marriage. It provides a kind of wider angle context for the shorter books: A Man's Story, A Woman's Story, A Simple Passion, Shame, and so on.  I think if the Nobel committee had read A Frozen Woman and then The Years, the longest book, which makes some of her purposes clearer, to tell a life—hers--but tacking back and forth between her own experience to the cultural and historical purpose in general, that might have been just enough to garner her the award. All of her books are memory experiments, autofiction, but in this one she uses the third-person “we” that seems to include others like her—from the time of her birth in 1941 to 2006, after which she published the book in 2008 in France. This English translation is listed at 2017.  The book sort of chronicles the history of all that time and her life in terms of it, and as a person who is roughly ten years younger than Ernaux, and though I'm American and a male, I felt like I could still relate to a lot of the cultural and political and even personal history she shares. The style is sort of a combination of narrating her life amidst a list of events, things she remembers from ads, songs, newspapers, tv and so on, from her childhood to grandmother-hood. This one is 250 pages, and many of those short novels come in at about 90-100 pages.  Ernaux is honored here with the Nobel—or if you don’t care about awards--just say she’s worth reading because she is, like Proust, experimenting with the problem of memory and how to speak to it, represent it. Very worthwhile reading.","Dave Schaafsma"
"A fascinating memoir written in a unique style - thoughts, ideas and memories along with the historical context of the times. Some of Ernaux's insights really resonated with me. I understand why this book received a Nobel prize, although see that it wouldn't appeal to everyone. I really admire the translator.","Diane Law"

"115th book of 2022.  I thought I'd give Ernaux a read post-Nobel win, as I read her Getting Lost pre-Nobel and wasn't hugely impressed. The Years is often considered her masterpiece. I think reading a memoirist is different to reading fiction writers in that you need to build a connection with them before you begin to read about their lives and their feelings, in the same way a novel prepares us for caring about the characters involved by allowing us to get to know them. In Getting Lost I was thrown into Ernaux's diaries from a period in which she was having an affair and found it, mostly, uninspiring and boring. In a similar fashion, I felt the same emotions beginning this book.  The Years is a slippery book, a term I decided I wanted to use in my review about half way through and was surprised to read, in the last few pages, Ernaux call the book, herself, slippery. It's like the memoir version of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire"*. Beginning in the 1940s and running into the 21st century, Ernaux creates a portrait of France, partly the whole world. It's hugely impersonal which, in turn, creates the personal. The book riffs off photographs, beginning with the personal and then expanding to world movements, famous deaths, technology. In some places the book begins to feel a little list-like, which is where I started to grow tired of reading it. The back half of the novel saved any boredom though, as Ernaux begins to dissect why she wanted to write it and what her purpose was, in the same way Mallo does at the end of his Nocilla Trilogy.  She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from 'Gone With the Wind', read at the age of twelve, and later from 'Remembrance of Things Past', and more recently from 'Life and Fate': an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn't yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a coincidence, like the madeleine dipped in tea for Marcel Proust.  So this can act as a sort of blurb and the answer to all her questions is reading the book itself. So 5-stars for Ernaux's vision, some 3-star feelings for some of her prose in the beginning, before the novel gathers its momentum, some 4-stars for bits in the middle. A real mix. I'm going to have to read it unrated. Ernaux interests me though, and I'm pleased, all things considered, that she won the Nobel for what she's doing with the form. Anyone playing with the form is to be respected. The image of her burying her cat whilst simultaneously, in her mind, burying everyone she has ever lost, will stick with me. There's a lot in this book about things repeating themselves, time happening at the same time, always, as Einstein said, that the past, present and future are all an illusion. ____________________________  *Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnnie Ray South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMaggio Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe Rosenbergs, H-bomb, Sugar Ray, Panmunjom Brando, "The King and I", and "The Catcher in the Rye" Eisenhower, Vaccine, England's got a new queen Marciano, Liberace, Santayana, goodbye We didn't start the fire It was always burning, since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it Joseph Stalin, Malenkov, Nasser and Prokofiev Rockefeller, Campanella, Communist Bloc Roy Cohn, Juan Peron, Toscanini, Dacron Dien Bien Phu falls, "Rock Around the Clock" Einstein, James Dean, Brooklyn's got a winning team Davy Crockett, Peter Pan, Elvis Presley, Disneyland Bardot, Budapest, Alabama, Krushchev Princess Grace, Peyton Place, Trouble in the Suez We didn't start the fire It was always burning, since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it Little Rock, Pasternak, Mickey Mantle, Kerouac Sputnik, Chou En-Lai, "Bridge on the River Kwai" Lebanon, Charles de Gaulle, California baseball Starkweather homicide, children of thalidomide Buddy Holly, Ben Hur, space monkey, mafia Hula hoops, Castro, Edsel is a no-go U2, Syngman Rhee, Payola and Kennedy Chubby Checker, Psycho, Belgians in the Congo We didn't start the fire It was always burning, since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it Hemingway, Eichmann, "Stranger in a Strange Land" Dylan, Berlin, Bay of Pigs invasion "Lawrence of Arabia", British Beatlemania Ole Miss, John Glenn, Liston beats Patterson Pope Paul, Malcolm X, British politician sex JFK – blown away, what else do I have to say?

"My expectations were very high due to the many good reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't like the book much. This book is full of lists of French politics and political figures, French historical events, such as specific French strikes, and French writers and songs. The book is suitable and inclusive if you are French and age 70-90. If you are not, the names, events, and environments described in the book are difficult to relate to. I wanted to understand her life and her generation's life, but I ended up just skimming through most of the book since she overwrites her own life with French history instead of opening up to the reader.","Eushia"
"This is the second book by Annie Ernaux that I have read recently. Ever since I have been asking myself why haven't I heard about her until she won the Nobel Prize?","Sam toer"
"It was interesting to compare this book to Ian McEwan's Lessons, since both used different narrative structures to cover a broad historical overview. Ernaux's slight incorporation of personal photographs into the historical narrative made her narrative felt much more grounded in the times and less forced than McEwan's. Lessons felt forced, The Years felt effortless and even though it was France, the whole lifespan came alive.  The Nobel was deserved.","Kent Winward"

"A LOVELY EVOCATION OF THE YEARS 1940-2007  Through the eyes of a French woman we see a kaleidoscopic view of the world between her birth in 1940 and 2007. Originally written in French, the English translation is brisk with many references to changes in France over those years. A lively and entertaining book that I read from cover to cover on a 10 hour flight, I highly recommend it. She won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature.","ronald f young"

"As soon as the Swedish Academy had announced the winner of this year’s (2022) Nobel Prize for Literature I reserved Annie Ernaux’s “Les Années” from our local library. I was not quick enough and did not get the first reservation, but now I have read the spectacular book. Based at least on this one book this year’s laureate is more than worthy of her prize.  In a sense the book is a memoir of the author. It is also a wonderful rendition of life in the latter half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. The history of Europe of that period runs alongside the author’s private life. In the beginning focus is more on the private side of the author’s life. By the eighties focus turns more to politics, philosophy, lifestyle etc. to return to the more personal after the Millennium.  The book is written in the style of a diary, at times even aphoristic – small snapshots of her personal life backed by a profound depiction of the history of France and the rest of Europe and the world. You just could not let go of the book; it was so inspiring reading. Interesting is that the book is written in the third person with much passive voice. By this the writer distances herself from the events, but she still is very much present. This contributes to generalize the narrative without losing the personal touch.  The book covers a long historical process with focus on Europe and her personal life in that current. From the Post War times through Mai ’68 to the disillusions of consumerism. How technology has changed and continues to change our lives and thinking. How Internet has become the center of our lives where we do not find what we seek… and often do not even need.  A revelation that hit me as a reader was how the author described her shock of realizing that she had started to represent the oldest living generation. I too have found myself there.  The last pages of the book provide the reader with the author’s idea of what her book is all about. Another interesting twist among many.  I read the book in Finnish translation and must congratulate the translator Lotta Toivanen for her excellent work. Most of all I admire how she has found Finnish equivalents to many French puns in the book.  FINNISH: Kiitokset Lotta Toivaselle hienosta käännöksestä. Erityisesti ihailin alun sanaleikkien käännöksiä – nerokasta.","Kenneth"
"Read it in English of course.","Alexandra Lutyens"
"A stream of consciousness, memories stapled over each other, often very French incidents that I know little or nothing of. This makes it a hard read and I just want it to end. And then when 10% of the book remains she lunges into a rant about the world, our technological progress etc that is just great. Razor sharp and I realise why she got the Nobel prize. I just wish she could amaze me more often.","Anders Tempelman"
"This is an incredible book and an excellent translation by Alison L. Strayer. I’ve never read a memoir like this before, in which the personal and the public are so inextricable, and Strayer renders Ernaux’s revolutionary use of the “je collectif” in a dizzying mix of approximate pronouns that pull the reader into the generational tides of the narrative. I’ll be thinking about this one for a long time.","Kim Nall"
"When I started reading this book I thought it was a bit boring and that I might not continue. While I was thinking about it - I did read half of the book and then was hooked to finish it. Now that I've finished it - I am not quite sure if I remember much of what I've read. Just a life.","Daniil Lanovyi"
"4.5 I was overcome with emotion when I got to the end of the book, and I don't really know why. The Years gave me similar feelings from when I read Stoner by John Williams and watched Mirror directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. It's the recounting of history and things past over the course of an entire life that's so overwhelming and beautiful. There's nothing else like this.","Shannon Gunning"

"Could not get interested.","Claudia"
"This is a very special book. A memoir of both and individual and a society. Ambitious, wise, and moving. Ernaux traces her life from post-WWII France to the 2000s in moving prose, painting both her life's portrait and the collective conscious of France during that time.","Shane Ha"
"Not as involving as I wanted it to be, partially because I don’t know 20th century French history that well so the lengthy sections describing reactions to political and social crises and events didn’t resonate - except for the section on May ‘68, since I took a fascinating seminar on that. However the sections were she got personal with her own life were intimate, penetrating and very intriguing. Definitely a mixed experience over all, but would be interested in reading her memoirs that focus solely on her.  But congrats to Miss Annie on her Nobel!","Liam Oznowich"
"I have no idea what to think of this book. I'm not sure it was written for someone like me. There was no catharsis while reading, but it was interesting to dive into.","Klára Salcmanová"
"A web of references that tremble across one another to form a quilt depicting the lives of past French generations, the gossamer of the narrative as airily light as memory. It's not entirely my cup of tea - I prefer something a bit more emotionally engaging - but I found the concept intriguing and well executed.  One can almost see the narrator ageing, particularly in the latter pages, when she becomes bewildered and fearful of the way the world is changing, the ease with which younger people seamlessly absorb the new tech. One cannot help but go back to the earlier pages and see how Ernaux has cleverly shown how the callousness of her own youth gave way to the fragility of old age - a poignant representation of how no matter the era, the vitality and passion of youth yields to displacement and doubt.  Ernaux ends by stating the idea that began The Years: "By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of history."","Tom"
"Looking at the story of one's life in retrospect. Giving an unsentimental autobiographical account. Sharing her precious memories with the reader. Describing the ages and stages that are closely connected to the history of the country and the society. The memories of what she did, thought and felt at different times of her life. The memories that has made her the person she is now. ","Olga"
"Thinking of the time it took to write this exhausts me. It is an amazingly impressive tribute to the years Ernaux lived and how she portrays the narrative as a collective and global memory is phenomenal.","Victoria Walters"
"A great time travel through a French womans lifespan with a particular focus on memories and emotions how they are moulded according to the changes in society and family relationships.","Torben Berner"
"Read in English (beautifully translated). Didn’t know what to expect but this was a joy. Apparently based on a series of photographs and videos the narrator describes her life from innocent childhood through anxious adolescence, relationships and professional development to the anxieties of ageing. All national and international events are described, especially as they affected her and her family: the Cold War, 9/11, the Iran/Iraq war and many others, all, of course, from a French perspective. An excellent personal diary of the second half of the Twentieth Century and into the Twenty first.","Bob"

"Her style is mesmerizing. I listened to it on Audible and recommend that as a way to read it because it feels like a lovely, long story being read aloud.","Anne Wrider"
"Incredible book. The personal pronouns alone are fascinating, not to mention the lists which create discordant juxtapositions, and the continual irony and humor. A brilliant voyage through 60 years of AE's life in the context of French history and culture. Since we live in a global world, so much of what she touches upon--perhaps most particularly, the continual reinvention and attraction of consumer culture--will resonate with all readers. The most innovative memoir I've ever seen. So capacious in scope while simultaneously being intimate in its humor which is usually directed at herself/her generation. No wonder she won the Nobel Prize! Now to read some of her other books!","Kathleen McCormick"
"I listened to the audio version of the English translation of this, and it was spectacular. Done know second person, it is a fictional biography told in small bits with much pop culture, politics, and international news. For a reader of my years it's a brilliant remembering. For a younger reader I think it would be a tremendous statement about how we remember our coming of age through events.","Mary Kay"
""everything will be erased in a second. the dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. all there will be is silence and no words to say it. nothing will come out of the open mouth, I or me. language will continue to put the world into words. in conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation."  ernaux's musings on memory, mortality, the impermanence of the present moment, and the sentimentality of the passing of time are spectacular, made even more impressive by her unusual attempt to capture a collective rather than individual experience. most memoirs are trapped by the author's own subjectivity. ernaux recognizes this limitation, but also beautifully conveys the unity of experiencing a particular moment in time, blending personal anecdotes with history, descriptions of photos, niche cultural references, and generationally-specific slang. her reflections on the feminist movement and modernization are particularly fascinating, illuminating how such drastic changes were actually felt by those experiencing them through astute attention to seemingly trivial details.  while "the years" oftentimes frustrated me due to the narrator's distance, the idiosyncrasy of the narrative ultimately moved me in a way few memoirs have. i guess the impermanence of life has been weighing on me lately- even thinking back to four years ago, both I and the collective culture seem to have already changed so drastically, making the past heartbreakingly intangible. it's not that this nostalgia is justified, as I realize life wasn't actually any better then. it's just sad to me that I, and the world, will never feel that specific way again, and the "feeling"of that moment in time feels impossible to really articulate to anyone but myself, trapped in my memory forever. reading "the years" didn't exactly quell these feelings, but somewhat validated them, and reaffirmed my need to at least try to be more present in the current moment","Lily"
"Well, I feel like I have a good idea of what it was like growing up in France after World War II, but after it hit, oh, about 9/11, it started to feel a little old-man-yells-at cloud.","Joe"
"Thoroughly dense, and filled with astonishing clarity. I’m unsure how connected I felt to the images and events of the past, especially the separation between the culture I know and France. So impersonal and distant that it was hard to relate in some circumstances. Nonetheless, by the end of the novel, as the images and Ernaux’s purpose fell into place, the book became a record of a world in the most incredible detail. A complex and strange novel that I’ll continue to think about and mull over for some time. 3.5 stars.","James Peppercorn"
"Simply the best book I've read in several years.","Carolina Frisk"
"History experienced as a women. A beautiful ad unbelievably intimate and universal experience that broke the boundary of culture, demography, and age.","Fiona Song"
"As I began this book I noticed a surge of surprising responses within myself.  To start, the structure of the book is innovative for the genre which is a memoir of her life, but is written like no memoir I’ve read before. Instead of using the intimate first person singular, she adopts the first person plural, we”, or sometimes, “she.” This has the effect of putting the reader at arms length, and feels detached. It feels very French, formal. Quelle froideur, I thought as she presents her life from early childhood memories to old age. But then something changed. As I became more immersed in her life review, I began to appreciate what Annie Ernaux is doing by forging a new method. She is in the story, yes, but she is also speaking more broadly of her generation, a specific subset that is provincially rooted yet educated, intellectual, self aware. I love that her personal narrative is braided into the larger political, economic, and social events of her time. This book made me feel the shock of the massive changes that have transformed, for better and worse the period from the 1940s to the second decade of the 21st century.  There are plenty of French references to politicians and writers that went over my head, but also points of convergence that anyone close to her age in the West can relate to.  In the end, her melancholy at the death of her youthful dreams was balanced somewhat by her treasured moments. Oh, and she has a young lover many years her junior. Oh, those French women!","Connie"
"Just an amazing read.","Nima Morgan"
"I'm embarrassed to say that until Annie Ernaux won the Nobel Prize this year, I had never heard of her. So I did a little research to find what was considered her best work and came up with The Years. If this little gem is in any way representative of Ernaux's work, her Nobel is one of the most deserved in quite a while. Describing The Year is not easy but the best description I've found is "impersonal biography." While book is autobiographical in the sense that it sort of tells Ernaux's history from shortly after she was born (in 1940) until 2006, that history is more that of her generation than of her personally. The style is quite experimental but an experiment that works. The style fits the story emotionally and intellectually particularly to this reader who essentially lived through the same time period and who, despite living in the US rather than France had remarkably similar experiences. I look forward to reading more Ernaux.","James Spencer"
"Nobel prize-winning book – which is more like a memoir than fiction, and depicts images and cultural norms and events at various points in her life. I found this book quite difficult to get into because of its structuring in terms of images rather than as an intentional connecting narrative. Ernaux is writing in her 60s and in a life span that is fairly similar to mine (she is a decade older), and my initial reaction was that I identified a lot with a lot of the memories and sociological perspectives, but didn't feel I got much from reading this compared with the kinds of memories and conversations I have already. The sociological and cultural evocations seemed particularly familiar, but I’d be interested in how they would seem if you were a quite different age, or had not been reading the French intellectuals Ernaux mentions and whose work is so well known in the international academic community. I did enjoy the commentary on French politics and of Ernaux's and her friends’ hopes and judgements at different elections – this was interesting in itself and also evoked memories of my own generations feelings at different Australian elections over the same period.","lyny"
"Beautifully written, Ernaux's narrative highlights the profundity of the passage of time framed through the scope of both personal events/memories and the corresponding broad-strokes events of the time. Memories, people, minutiae and the specific written framing of all three aid in the creation of a truly moving work, one that serves to highlight the significance of life through the lens of time's movement.  Ernaux's insights throughout the piece are coupled with a wide array of specific moments, ones existing both outside the scope of her own personal life (politics and sociological/socioeconomic/sociopolitical/etc trends in particular) and through specific personal events themselves.  The way she manages to intertwine these moments alongside both retrospective insights and the sentiments she felt at the time allots the reader a sense of continuation in narrative form, while also providing both a profound degree of depth and a direct contextualization of the events that are occurring. This dichotomy of retrospective thought, coupled with her chronicling of the actual events themselves, allows for a deeply multifaceted presentation of both the events themselves and how their significance is viewed through two varying frameworks: the past and the present.  From the ending of WW2 to the invasion of Hungary in the 40s and 50s to the election of Sarkozy and the advent of the Wii in the mid-oughts, all enwoven with her family life, her thoughts on consumer society, death, and still a litany of other subjects, Ernaux's work, in large part facilitated by the lightness of her prose, succeeds in detailing the significance of the poignancy of the passage of time.  'Save something from the time where we will never be again'  ","John"
"This is a really beautifully written book. You are swept along through the life of the protagonist. I am of a similar age so identified with her too. I gave 4 stars because the French cultural references were lost on me and the translation was very American/Canadian which I am afraid grates on me as a Brit.","unknown"
"Unreal. There isn’t anything I can imagine comparing it to- it seems to invent and subvert genre at the same time. Since Ernaux won the Nobel Prize, I’ve finally gotten around to reading her, having started with A Man’s Place and A Woman’s Story. To say this is a total departure in tone and style is an understatement- the terseness of those and other of her books is traded for a decadence of detail and sensation in The Years. It’s not a memoir, not a history- it’s something else. Totally compelling.","Brian"
"Based on diaries and presented in the collective singular, Annie Ernaux presents a memoir of her life over a period of fifty years, depicting life of a woman in France from WWII onwards to 2006. Surprisingly earthy, extremely generous, and for those of us who lived the same decades, familiar.","Kasa Cotugno"
"a wonderful exploration of memory, aging and the intersection of personal & social history. i particularly loved ernaux’s preoccupation with what it means to remember/write/invent the story of one’s life and everything that entails. fair warning though this is VERY french with sooooooooo many allusions to french culture and society that went over my head","Sammy Mylan"
"Interesting retrospective of life- in context of societal attitudes changing over time within the framework of world (or more so, french) historical events","Johanne"
"At first sight, this is a chronicling of local and world events through a French eye, told in the third person. But it is actually Ernaud’s memoir, of the period 1941 to 2006 when she was 66. She writes mostly about herself through a left-leaning sociological lens in a jaunty and original style. We go from a deeply religious, puritanical France through the transformations of the 60s, particularly what that means in revising sexual values and actions, what French presidents came and went, Mitterand Good, Chirac Bad, how neo-liberalism transformed us, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and French students throwing stones. All is told from a point of view, hers, with witty turns of phase: “The president of the United States, George W Bush insipid son of the one before, ludicrously elected after endless vote recounts, proclaimed the clash of civilizations, Good against Evil.” I could appreciate about half of what she was enthusing about because I am not French, but it is an admirable piece of work, deceptively simply: that is not.","John"
"This is a masterpiece.  You can't be a writer of anything even remotely serious in intent and not read this. I am serious. You Have to read this. No exaggeration.  I have just finished it. I am staggered. Stunned. Amazed.  It is not Proust but it has that quality with time but it also has that quality with life and politics and showing a world gone by that is lived by a person. She lives it and it lives her. We are brought there. We remember ourselves.","Julia Barclay-Morton"
"The Years is the story of my generation. Set in France from 1940-2006, much of it feels removed, a wide ranging history of a time. There is a remove as a result of this, but always luscious language: “The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.” In the last part, the voice changes and becomes more immediate, the character more available. It's about the author and aging rather than a sweeping history.  ","Ann Pearlman"
"“The years” by Annie Ernaux, one of the most important and well-read French memoirists, is a collection of recollections — or the compilation of “abbreviated memories,” as she calls them. The book is placed somewhere on the edges of literature, history, and sociology. It moves in fragments, from personal to common, from exceptional to ordinary and vice versa. This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read; you might call it a collective autobiography  Ernaux was raised in a traditional working-class Roman Catholic family in Normandy, and the first two-thirds of her book is generational. It is only as Ernaux moves into the 21st century that she becomes completely individual — retired, divorced, a campus writer, the mother of two grown sons.  Ernaux examines each year of her life, from 1940 to 2006, without ever using the pronoun “I.” As if she is absent from her own life, and the memories belong to a stranger. In a unique way for memoir writing, her narration is told from the point of view of an ambiguous third person.  She shows it is possible to write personally and collectively, situating her own story in the story of her generation. All of her work blends together her own personal experiences as well as collective historical experiences to create heartbreakingly beautiful memoirs that take the reader by the hand and gently lead them through the passing of time. In The Years, in particular, the narrator’s “she” turns into us and one and we.  She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”  The process of reading The Years is similar to a treasure box discovery, filled with old family photo albums, some having a few words in the back, yellowish and falling apart. For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over. You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past. The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived — captured only in photos and partially in memory— have vanished","Gonçalo Madureira"
"Autofiction at its near best, neither malicious nor ingratiating, a tour de force on the evolving definition of being a woman based on the experiences of a brave, brutally honest and perspicacious one.","Cynthia Abraham"
"Listened to this in English, which is also the language in which I own the paperback.  Fascinating! Mix of historical and literary events and personal memoir. Definitely "worth the time" -- and it never felt heavy, just sometimes as referring to European (especially French) events with which I am not familiar.","Lily"
"If Annie Ernaux had never written another word beyond the first thirty pages of this book, she would have earned a Nobel Prize.","Jean"
"If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would.

"We joked, “God is dead, Marx is dead, and I don’t feel so good either.” We had a sense of play.  Play is a good term. Ernaux is playing with memory. It is her story. She was born in France during the Second World War, as she recalls the hardships on her family, the rebuilding of the country and their zeal to forget what happened. She grows up, goes to college, becomes a teacher, talks about sex and abortion (told in another book), gets married, has children, gets disallusioned with marriage, it ends, starts life anew, has an affair with a younger man (another book too), retires and reflects on her life, her country and history. Sixty-five years.  It is also look back at the latter half of the twentieth century. It’s our collective history. May 1968, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 911 are landmarks. She covers themes like politics, sexual politics, war (there are a lot of them and how quickly we forget), and global events. Terrorism, racism, immigration, feminism, and religion. It reflects on how technology has changed us, slowly at first then it’s everywhere. It is a tale of us.  She speaks to us in third person and never singles herself out. It’s not really an autobiography but rather a recalling of life and events of this time. Her story is triggered by Ernaux looking at old photographs, Super 8 movies and videos. That is her play.  Buried in the book is the spark to write this book. What is the “Madeline” that trigger her to write this Proustian tale? Just as Proust reflected on his life, times, loves and events, Ernaux does the same (in much less pages).  It’s her life and our life all wrapped into one continuous story. Impersonal and yet oddly personal. Indelibly odd, beautiful and at times funny. How does our memory work on the past? Are these accurate and does it matter?  So many these events I could relate to which made me realize the common thread that binds us together. She is French and twenty years older than myself but her words triggered my own memories. Perhaps we humans are not as different as we think we are? What binds us together is more than what separates us.  Now I understand why she used the word “we” to describe her life. We really can’t separate ourselves from the world. Our world. Our past. The years.","David"
"I have just finished this unusual book, the recipient of this year's Nobel Prize for Literature. The author, Annie Ernaux, is now in her eighties and she looks back over her life which began during World War II. She remembers events in France and worldwide, describing the way life has changed in a clear-sighted and sometimes ironic way. It isn't a very personal story; although she glimpses herself in photographs throughout the decades, her view is more generalised - sometimes incisive, sometimes almost dreamlike, and always compellingly frank.  'The sticky body of adolescence met the superfluous being of existentialism'  'We knew that a family meal was a place where one could go mad without warning and push the table over, screaming'  'Leningrad was St Petersburg again, much more convenient for finding one's way around the novels of Dostoevsky'","Mary-rose"
"Personal narrative that is also a generational memoir. The narrator uses "we" instead of "I" and never uses personal names. There are numerous references to songs, movies, television shows, pop culture and politics in France that I had to look up or didn't understand. Interesting for how French society and culture changed from 1940 to the mid 2000s. Readers of social history or Francophiles may enjoy this. It is probably better in the original French and will appeal more to French readers than Americans.","Carly Thompson"
"Annie Ernaux won the Nobel Prize for Literature this year and I’d never heard of her so I decided I should fix that. But wow. This book was a real slog for me. It took me a month to get through because I kept putting it down. It’s really just the thoughts going on in her head throughout the course of most of her life, starting in 1946-ish through 2010-ish. There’s a reason that much of Ms. Ernaux’s work has not been translated into English. Ms. Ernaux is French and she writes of many things (not all!) that are specifically of interest to French people. I found myself googling a lot. So while this author has an undeniably brilliant mind, her story just didn’t captivate me as it would have had I been living her experiences too.","Brooke"
"Surprising, beautiful, astonishingly original in feel, yet universal in scope and appeal. What a marvelous way to tell the story of a life, all linked to place, politics, music, memory, and so so much more. Most exciting literary revelation in a while.","Jennifer"
"not my favorite of her books, but unquestionably her most iconic and pathbreaking work.","Peter"
"This is the only thing I've read by Annie Ernaux. Her approach at a memoir is a bit untraditional. Starting in the 1940's and covering memories through the early 2000s, her writing doesn't follow a specific plotline but reads more like snippets of memory strung together to capture a lifetime of all the little details of a life lived. It felt like looking through her photo albums in chronological order and getting her memories not only of what was happening in the pictures, who is off camera and more details that a picture can evoke about the moment but also pulls on what is going on in pop culture, politics, society at large, consumerism, experiences of the age (i.e, teenage years; early parenthood; post divorce and empty-nesting). A zooming in and zooming out on each core memory. Annie writes from the lens of someone experiencing growing up in France, but poses an interesting question of what core memories surface depending on your country of origin. Having myself spent a large portion of my childhood (1988-1992 and 2000-2007) living in Germany (and the rest in the US), some of Annie's memories were similar to my own: remembering the flood of East Germans when the Berlin Wall came down, the novelty of checking which country your Euro came from and I found this especially interesting as I have a personal connection. The concept of writing a running monologue of memories over decades of time before the brain starts to fail in old age thus erasing those memories really makes for a fantastic and very personal memoir.","Duckoffimreading"
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Memory, Time, Education Writing.  The four things that stood out to me very much in Annie Ernaux’s The Years— the winner of the Nobel prize in literature this year, 2022.  I picked this short book very randomly— I was bored with my other current reads and the Nobel prize was just announced around this time. Of a curiosity about why Annie Ernaux was chosen as the laureate, I picked up the book and am glad to say that now, I know why she won.  The Years was a beautiful, breathless piece of writing about time—-about Annie Ernaux but not limited to her own self. Honestly, it's much more fitting that this is an autobiography of a generation.  Taling or instead reminiscing the things that happened from the 1940s to 2007.  There is something nostalgic in Annie Ernaux’s way of laying moments in her life down in the book. I am not a french person yet reading what the french kids did way back in her childhood still gave me this feeling of nostalgia.  It's also fascinating to see the passage of time here— the narrator growing up from being a kid to a woman in her sixties. The historical event she experienced reminisced— all the wars, all the revolutions, the turn of the century; the feeling of transitioning from 1900 to 2000 and how underwhelming it is—it was like watching a life taking shape.  Annie Ernaux’s Prose too pioneered the greatness of the book. The content was already great, but Ernaux’s way of writing with such rawness and intimacy, and beauty elevated everything to heaven.  Aside from memory and time, Ernaux also wrote about her desire to write and what is education for her. The desire to study and write makes you want to change the world and cement yourself in history, which I could relate to heavily.  And there are also moments so raw that it felt invasive to read. It felt like I have read something from a diary that I was not supposed to see yet it captivated me because of its immense beauty and intimacy, which made me just emotional from reading it.  Quotes that resonated with me very much;     about memory:  Memory was transmitted not only through the stories but through the ways of walking, sitting, talking, laughing, eating, hailing someone, grabbing hold of objects. It passed body to body, over the years, from the remotest countrysides of France and other parts of Europe: a heritage unseen in the photos, lying beyond individual difference and the gaps between the goodness of some and the wickedness of others.  Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation  about mother:  When it comes to her mother, she remembers the eyes, the hands, the silhouette; the voice, only in the abstract, without texture. The real voice is lost; she has no concrete remnant of it. But phrases often rise to her lips spontaneously, the same ones her mother used in the same contexts, expressions she didn’t remember ever using herself, “The weather is sluggish,” “He talked my ear off,” “You have to wait your turn, like at confession,” etc. It was if her mother were speaking through her mouth, and with her an entire lineage. Other phrases come into her head sometimes, the ones her mother used after she got Alzheimer’s. Their incongruity revealed her mother’s altered mental state, “You can bring me some rags to wipe my bottom with.” In a flash, her mother’s body and presence are returned to her. Unlike the former sentences, repeatedly used, the latter are unique, forever the preserve of one sole being in the world, her mother.  about Writing:  To see her in the photo, a handsome solid girl, one would never suspect that more than anything, she fears going mad. Only writing—or perhaps a man—can protect her from that, if only momentarily. She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.  About education:  It seems to her that education is more than just a way to escape poverty. It is a weapon of choice against stagnation in a kind of feminine condition that arouses her pity, the tendency to lose oneself in a man, which she has experienced (see the high school photo from five years before) and of which she is ashamed. She feels no desire to marry or have children. Mothering and the life of the mind seem incompatible. In any case, she’d be sure to be a bad mother. Her ideal is the union libre in the poem by André Breton. At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels “hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories,” that she is “looking for another language” and “longs to return to an original purity.” She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are “little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night.” Other sentences contradict this lassitude: “I am a will and a desire.” She does not say for what.  About aging:  She feels no age difference with women of forty-five or fifty, an illusion which the latter destroy in the course of conversation, without malice but implying that she doesn’t belong to the same generation as they, and is seen by them in the way she herself sees a woman of eighty, i.e., old. Unlike adolescence, when she was sure of not being the same from one year or even one month to the next, now she feels immutable in a world that moves ahead in leaps and bounds.  ","Ben Martizz"
"Wow, Annie Ernaux is the one. I cannot believe it's taken me so long to get into her memoirs. Many consider this her opus, which I totally get. A personal narrative that covers 60 years of her life that is also a political portrait of Paris and a feminist history of philosophy. Totally knocked my socks off, I don't have a very eloquent review to write. But read this. Or honestly read any books Ernaux has written. I can't wait to keep reading her.","Aden"
"“We scribbled down writers’ reflections on life, discovered the joys of describing ourselves to ourselves with shimmering turns of phrase, ‘existence is to drink oneself without thirst.’ We were overcome by nausea and a feeling of the absurd.”","Ami Boughter"

"A Proustian roll through the years 1940 to 2006 as seen through the heart, senses, and observations of the author, both an exemplar of her generation, the “we” and the one whose episodes from her personal story form the outline of the text. Nothing that happened in those 60+ years escapes comment: politics, culture, love, sex, child rearing, mortality, religion, economics, technology, (“the web was the royal road through the remembrance of things past”), immigration, class, war, and many isms. Interesting, at times intimate, exquisitely expressed. What becomes of the us that made us “us” when we are no longer? Who and how will we be remembered? The last line of the book provides a suggestion “save something from the time where we will never be again.” I didn’t want it to end.","Diane Kresh"
"I listened to the audio book. It starts with the main character's childhood in Normandy in the 1940s and ends in Paris after 2000. It is mostly autobiographical. The woman in question goes from the provinces to Paris on the basis of her education and devotion to ideas and literature. She becomes a teacher. She notes the many changes that occur in France that result from France's emergence as a modern industrial nation in the wake of World War II. She is a leftist. She sympathizes with the youthful rebels during the Days of May 1968. She becomes a feminist and divorces her husband. She has many affairs. All of this is narrated in a fairly straightforward but somewhat impersonal manner.","Jeffrey Hart"

"🌸🌸 All we have is our history, and it does not belong to us. – Jose Ortega y Gasset The book begins with this quote. What if I tell you the story of my life by not just telling you about myself but through a kaleidoscope of events happening around me at that time, the political upheavals, wars, and economic and social changes? Ideologies? Class struggle? Changes in the leadership?Annie Ernaux tells the story of her life through all these and photographs, obscure incidents, and the people around her. She talks about the various presidents: Vincent Auriol, Coty, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, Chirac, to Sarkozy, and the changes brought about by the negative or positive impact of these changes on the people then. She just talks about the collective impact rather than a personal one. 🌸🌸 Something that I noted was how she portrays the changes in the lives of women, be it freedom or women's empowerment from the time that she was a child to the current era and how the woman of the bygone eras was bereft of any kind of freedom and gradually many social and legal changes occurred with time. French women obtained women’s suffrage in 1944. Simone De Beauvoir is a major exponent who influenced with her writings. She and Sartre are mentioned time and again in the book. She talks about many french authors, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Virginia Woolf, Proust and many more. There are many incidents she quotes which may be more relatable to the French because it was all French to me! ( Greek to me!) 🌸🌸 Another aspect of the book that I really liked was that through her narrative one could sense the technological advances people made from then till 2006. (The book covers a period from 1940 to 2006) how people of the earlier generation find it difficult to use a computer or a mobile and are awed at how children handle it with a lot of dexterity. She also observes changes in the religious outlook of the people around her. The changes portrayed are all not very obvious but one can notice them. 🌸🌸 The book is not an easy read, as one reads through, one can gyrate with the vibrations of the book. I had to go back and forth to understand many aspects. It’s a short book but requires your full time and attention. I read it with the members of the unofficial book club, who choose amazing books! THIS WILL NOT BE A WORK OF REMEMBRANCE IN THE USUAL SENSE, AIMED AT PUTTING A LIFE INTO STORY, CREATING AN EXPLANATION OF SELF. -ANNIE ERNAUX, THE YEARS","anusha_reads"
"Four and a half stars.  "It will be a slippery narrative, composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.... There is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we,' as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before."  Fascinating, sometimes too slippery and oblique (for this American reader anyway—Ernaux draws heavily on French cultural references as markers of time passing and life unfolding, and a lot of them were new to me, through no fault of the author's). If you're intrigued by memory and how we make sense of and hang onto the disjointed pieces of our lives, this book will probably fascinate you as well. Just don't go in expecting a brisk plot. If Proust had been born in the 1940s, this is what he might have written if he could have persuaded himself to embrace a collective singular voice instead of "I." But it's rooted very strongly in the embodied experience of a girl/woman living through the changes of the postwar years, and I think Marcel would have been knocked for a loop when it came to describing that state of being. :)  Bonus for this student of clutter and our obsession with stuff: The novel is, among other things, a chronicle and critique of consumer society as it ramps up after the war. ","Jennifer Howard"
"I read the translated edition entitled The Years. It started out as a catalog or listing of events that the author remembers as a child. I found the lists tedious at first until I realized that they serve the purpose the writer intended. Her thoughts were to “retrieve the memory of collective memory in an individual memory”! Her plan was to “ capture the lived dimension of memory...going within herself to retrieve the world.” In other words, it is not a real autobiography, but her presence in the world from the early 1940’s to the middle of the first decade of the twenty first century. She does not write about her role(s) in life, but her experiences as they were colored by the times she lived. The second half is effective in its intent to reflect the changing world and its turmoils! Her use of personal photograph descriptions, one for each decade or so, remind us that she is part of the narrative. I believe this is an important book for everyone to read!","Afaf Finan"
"I can't stop reading Annie Ernaux. In this book she tells her opinion and how she experienced the events from her childhood (she was born in 1940) until 2006.  Events that I did not experience are effusively narrated: the German occupation, the rescue of France, the presidents who have governed it, the strict and religious education, virginity as the most important value for women, etc.  And then the evolution of France in many aspects, especially in women's freedoms and acquired rights.  Her thoughts and her feelings at important moments in recent history reminded me of my own.  Excellent book.","Juan Rivera"
"a reimagining of the memoir in which one’s personal memory is inextricable from the collective experience of a place and time. once a moment is gone, it thereafter only survives in the memories of those who lived through it—how we collectively thought, spoke, and interacted with the world, which is constantly in flux. such experiences often feel nearly impossible to articulate—for most, there is a sense of insecurity speaking beyond the “I,” as most memoirs do, in favor of the “we,” as ernaux brilliantly manages to do here. I am still too young in many ways to be able to conceptualize these gradual changes as they are happening, but I wonder if the perpetual nostalgia I and many others have for the past extends beyond mere aesthetics, but a pondering of whether lived existence was truly different in an age of less technology, less questioning of tradition, less consumerism, less of the constant overstimulation that has long been inextricable from life as we know it. witnessing the last 80+ years of history through the eyes of a woman who has witnessed unimaginable amounts of social change leaves me with both an unshakeable sense of desolation for all that has been lost, yet a sense of comfort that there are humans who have been through all this before—and, in ernaux’s case, have the generosity to share their formidable knowledge. unlike anything I have read before, yet its universality and truth leaves me mystified as to how that can be true.","Abby"
"Never in my life have I read a book that embodies the phrase "the personal is political" as well as Annie Ernaux's Les Années. The book is not exactly a memoir, not exactly a collective history - but fits into a space in between that feels fresh and newly unlocked. I'm hesitant to categorize it here as "fiction" - but I also don't know what I would otherwise do with it.  It is in this fresh space that Ernaux operates in all her work - or so I've been told, especially in the recent massive media coverage following her Nobel prize. It's rare for me to read a Nobel winner and fully grasp what it is that they have done for literature, beyond just writing really good books. With Orhan Pamuk, my judgment is clouded by my experiences of the country and cities he describes; with Olga Tokarczuk, I'm simply too busy trying to figure out what is going on.  With Annie (I feel an urge to refer to her by first name, by virtue of the experiences we have just shared through her book), on the other hand, I can see clearly the absolute novelty of what she is doing. She reminds me both of Zola, naturalism, and the desire to be emotionally removed and as accurately descriptive as possible, and of Ferrante, and of her bold description of social class and historical change through the lives and relationships of ordinary women. Annie questions the relationship between the individual and society, and between writing like Zola and writing like Ferrante- in fact, she questions whether those things can even be considered distinct enough for them to then have a relationship with each other, as opposed to just being intrinsically part of one another.","Su Ülkenli"

So far the book is part personal memoir part historical events in parallel, more or less all in bullet form, interspersed with her dispassionate and concise insights.

"This book is essentially an autobiography structured around a chronology of French history, politics and societal change from WW II to the present. What follows is a summary rather than a review. While I avoid spoilers related to the author’s personal life, I really have to say SPOILERS FOLLOW.     The author (the 2022 Nobel Prize winner) picked a bad time to be born: 1940, right at the start of WW II. She grew up in a small town in Normandy, 90 miles from Paris, when people still didn’t travel much. “…when you never leave home, even the next town is the ends of the earth.” People who had seen the Eifel tower “took on an air of superiority.”  Sections of the story are introduced by photos, later movies, and videos of a girl and her family as is someone is flipping through an old album.  Some of the things we read about:  Black and white TV, radio and television jingles for products; the annual Tour de France bicycle race where she tracked riders' progress with dots on a map. They had radios but saw TV only in cafes and in store windows where people gathered to watch. All the religious stuff: boys and girls sat on separate sides in church, no meat on Fridays. The hardship of poverty – never throw anything away. Newspaper used as toilet paper. Her schooling at a parochial girls’ school and all the crazy misinformation girls spread about sex.  We mark time by great events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu, 1954. The fighting in Algeria. There are big international events too: the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles.  As a young teen she feels backward. Her family doesn't have a Frigidaire on indoor plumbing and she still hasn’t been to Paris. But there is an onslaught of new things: plastic cooking utensils replace metal ones; a gas stove replaces coal; a Formica kitchen table replaces the old wooden one covered with an oilcloth. Record players, hula hoops, transistor radios.  (This is not from the book, but from a magazine article I read recently mentioning how important the cheap transistor radio was that every kid could have. Parents controlled the music on the TV and the expensive big radio and record player in the living room. But now kids could listen to their own music in their rooms. Bing Crosby and Patti Page, parental favorites, did not promote rebellion.)  The author tells us that the feeling of endless progress was so strong in the 1960s that people talked of having a pill for food in 2000, robots would do the housework and people would be living on the moon. Did that happen?  There was ‘a pill’ though. In France, only available to married women. Girls thought “We’d be so free in our bodies it was frightening. Free as a man.”  The author makes much of the student strikes and political turmoil that upended the French nation starting in May 1968. That was a watershed in French history. She tells us that even years afterward, you might meet someone and think ‘What side was he on in 1968?’ After those events, “Now, everything one considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” She writes “1968 was the first year of the world.” After 1968, ‘everyone was supposed to be listened to’: women, gays, miners, prisoners, prostitutes.     Now the pictures in the album become those of a young married woman with kids, bringing in bags of groceries from a car. It was an era of materialism. “Spending was in the air.” And “The ideals of May 1968 were being transformed into objects of entertainment.” People dreamed of a country life (which most had gladly left behind by then), while they flocked to cities and suburbs.  But she tires of this life. Her new symbol is a shapeless dress that indicates “Fatigue and an absence of a desire to please.” She is seized “…for the first time by the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.” [LOL When is GR going to let us use italics without special formatting?]  The socio-political environment changes again. It’s a time of concern about Arab immigration – the Banlieue ghettos. Catholicism has essentially vanished from their lives. Sony Walkmans and computer games amplify the process of walling oneself off from society that began with the transistor radio. At a later age the author tells us the computer was “…the first object to which we ever felt inferior.” “We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging.”  I found it fascinating too that way back, starting in the 1960s, the anti-immigration platform of right-wing political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen who has continued his prejudices) presaged the racism and antisemitism of today’s American political scene where Le Pen “…was the guy who said out loud what others were secretly thinking.”  Late middle age is a time of dispossession. The kids have left home; the husband is gone, furniture is being sold off, parents are gone or going.  Did you ever read a book where you WANTED footnotes? There are dozens of references to French events that most Americans will be clueless about. Just one example: she mentions ‘the Petit-Clamant attack.’ That’s it. You have to look it up if you want to know that’s the name of a town where a hit squad fired machine guns at President de Gaulle’s car in an assassination attempt in 1962. (There are 20 or so footnotes, I guess for references that even French people might find obscure, but believe me, an American needs many more footnotes. We know from context that many are references to grisly crimes, such as Bruay-en-Artois.     I loved the book because I enjoyed learning about recent French history and politics. The author is a bit older than me but the timeline for innovations is about the same as it was for me since the US was probably a few years ahead of France in our ability to buy consumer stuff.  This is the second book I've read by the 2022 Nobel Prize winner (b. 1940). Almost all of her work is autobiographical. Her books in order, catalog her parents’ lives, her teenage years, her marriage, her affair with an East European man (Simple Passion, the first book of hers I read), an abortion she had, the onset of Alzheimer's, her mother's death, her battle with breast cancer.

"As memoirs and autobiographies go, The Years is certainly a different take. Annie Ernaux traces the years of her life from the post-war period up until the 21st century. It's a stylistically strange yet very readable book that often jolts you with changes of perspective but, overall, one that leaves a lasting impression of a talented and accent observer of the world as she knows it and as we've seen it. Often it is an irritating book as well, a endless, regurgitating stream of consciousness namedropping cultural references and historical moments. The result is a book that is very rooted in the French experience. Ernaux lists advertising slogans, pop culture and celebrity memories, fashion trends and movements of language in long, exhausting mantras. I am certain that the effect sparks more vivid memories if you are French - it would be interesting to read a book written in this style from a British writer - but even then the it would depend on which decade you grew up in.  Ernaux switches between "we", "she" and "I" at various points. The "we" is the most frustrating, implicating you in the stream of consciousness of which you don't, necessarily, feel a part of. The "she" is the most affective. Although there are no chapters in the book, it is divided by sudden descriptions of photographs, presumably of the author, written in that distanced third person narrative. It allows Ernaux a dispassionate self-analysis which would suffice - switching back to "we" seemed, often, unnecessary to me, almost a careless revealing of character. It does increase the sense of inclusion (again, maybe more effective if you are French and of the same generation) which seems to be part of the intention of the book - a mapping out of the universal experience of our past century.  When Ernaux aims in this direction, The Years is at it's most revealing. She tracks the surging tides of cultural change, of the way moods and opinions shift, slowly and then in great rushes of emotion. She focusses on the way in which a woman's place in society has shifted and improved, along with a brilliant and honest look at the way society relates itself to sex. She examines the way people of one generation adapt to the new ways of the next, nailing down all the embarassment and uncertainty that comes with it. Through those ghostly photographic descriptions, Ernaux looks at the generation gap, as well as the things that bind us through the decades. She opens up to the loneliness of growing older but also the liberation that age and confidence brings, the self-knowledge that allows you the freedom to express yourself in knew ways. Through it all, there is a constant, difficult fitting in with the ever-morphing world. The Years might sometimes be a stylistically uncomfortable book at times, but it does capture the speed with which our times are a'changing, the multitude of experiences that we go through in one life time, the endless, timesome and wonderful flux of this modern world. She centres herself within that whirlwind of time, but attempts to pull us all along and create a less lonely, universal experience of the last seventy years.","Thomas"
"I am not exactly sure why I picked this up when I was convinced I wouldn’t like it. I am not a great lover of autobiographies. I was frustrated at the outset, no chronological stability, no expected anecdotes, and most surprising of all, an autobiography that doesn’t use the pronoun ‘I’. ‘She’ was often in evidence when the author looked at herself in a photograph or mirror. ‘We’ and ‘They’ were frequently used too when she talked of herself as part of a people she identified with, or a people that she didn’t. It isn’t presented a story but almost like someone leafing their way through an album of events and commenting on whatever is being looked at. It is subtle in its comments. In one part she talks about the arrival of feminism and the feeling of freedom, and in the next section, she moves on to talk about families rushing to buy camcorders , finally mentioning that ‘He’ did all the filming. I have to admit I found myself suddenly swept up, carried along, and happily swallowed by it. It is one of my most fascinating reads this year. A must for anyone who has grown up through most of the events and changes that Ernaux went through, but probably for anyone who has grown up in a changing world, which I guess means practically all of us.","Paul Ataua"
"Written in the first person plural and the third person, in a series of elliptical fragments, Ernaux has given us her response to Proust for the second half of the twentieth century he inaugurated. Her auto-socio-biography is a new genre, born of autobiography, memoir, chronicle, auto fiction, for an age that has lost the ability to see consequences — or perhaps is more honest about their impossibility.","Ingrid Wassenaar"

"Wonderful book. Very thrilling to read and to see the years go by, relived and remembered through artefacts or their illusions. We ping pong between memories and considerations on them, somewhere along what Ernaux remembers and what she can make of it. The ending is a grand closing on this, on the fleeting frugality of the recollections we hold dear but that insist on escaping.  EDIT: looking back on this there are (in my opinion) some beautiful reflections on memory and the passing of time similar to those drawn by Barthes in Camera Lucida. "The Years" really reads like a lovely combination of memories and how they shape/are shaped by us and remarkable story-telling. Highly recommended!","José"

"Book club choice, hated by most. It’s a difficult book, even for one who knows some French. Lots of detailed references to peoples, places, films, writers, politicians, and philosophers famous in France. A rambling, chronological newsreel montage of Ernaux’s life.","Patty"
"I suspect I will enjoy this book more when I get older (I am 40+ now). Still, it is a fine combination of reminicence of personal memories and worldly happenings during the twentieth century (but French-based).  I read this with my book club. Some members just read it right through, some looked up most of the cultural references. I say you can read it either way, but one of them takes a lot more time...","Marie"
"Evocative, encyclopedic, historical, and thought-provoking. I wish there were a similar book detailing the American experience—there probably is. In the beginning, in the 1940s and 50s French countryside, I thought, “my God, we have EvERYTHING now”. By the end, I was more disillusioned by the accelerating rush of ”progress” (while still cognizant of how easy we have it)","Bill"
"- A collage of memories from the author's youth in the 1940s up to the years following her retirement, until 2006. Covers her own life, the experiences of her generation growing up in 20th century France, and the major sociopolitical developments of a French society dealing with familiar issues: socialism, abortion, distant wars, consumerism, technology. - Ernaux writes in a detached voice that switches between "we", "she", and "they", shifting constantly between the collective and the individual experience. Certain threads connect the fragments as the author tries to make sense of her past, her perception of herself, her understanding of the people before and after her, and how they perceive her. The writing is controlled and clean, but quiet and subdued. Sometimes the author seems to approach the big questions but then glance away, leaving things unsaid and avoiding lingering on anything for too long. This motivates a lot of thinking on the part of the reader. - Steeped in pop culture. As the events speed up towards the end, the constant references to aspects of French society (many of which are extremely niche for non-French readers) quickly catch up to modernity. This creates an interesting experience as we approach contemporary times and see more and more familiar brands and cultural references decorating Ernaux's memories. - On the point of time dilation: This book nominally covers Ernaux's life until she was ~66, and it seems to speed up after she becomes middle-aged, and especially after she retires. Personally, I felt that her recollection of most of the events that occur starting the 90s to be a low point in the book. She moves away from her personal experience, glossing over her post-marital trysts, breast cancer, and retirement. She has little interesting to say about society: her coverage of politics is tired, she is weary of new technology, and she hints at the growing disconnect between herself and her children's generation. Here, I think the book suffers from the recency of the events, and the author's age. Ernaux doesn't seem to have much substantial to say about the nineties or the noughties, and it is hard to separate her from so many other people in her generation struggling to navigate modern sensibilities. - While I respect Ernaux's attempt to paint a generational picture of her own understanding of a changing France, I felt that the balance was a little off. Sociopolitical events are certainly important, but she frequently favored covering news and politics over interpersonal relationships. This might be because much of her writing is autobiographical, so much of what she can say about her relationships has already been covered in her other books. While I would have liked for her to spend more time away from politics, I do think that this focus complemented her writing, which embodied a certain passivity and futility as time seems to carry Ernaux along the broader and inevitable changes of society. - I felt the book was at its best when Ernaux went further into the personal. Her recollection of things is highly motivated by her own point-of-view. She focuses on her own perceptions and feelings as she tries to take inventory of her entire past. We focus less on her actual relationships than on how she feels about things, how people make her feel, and how she tries to fit these relationships into the broader story of herself. I like it.  One final thought to close on. At a certain point, Ernaux, a schoolteacher, reflects on how difficult it is to communicate to her students how fundamentally different "things" are compared to when she was young, especially as a result of the sexual revolution marked by the advent of the pill. How can she make them understand all the ways that life has changed? Later, as she witnesses the introduction of the personal computer and the iPod, she remarks how the rapid penetration of technology into everyday life is accelerating societal change, so that she no longer has any expectations for how the world will look in ten years. She wonders about all the changes that her children and their children will experience in the next century, and how their lives will be incommunicable to her at the present moment.  The Years is an ambitious attempt to capture something, something through the lens of one woman's life. As society begins moving faster and faster, these sorts of recollections will only become more important. Years dilate but also become denser and denser; like dog years, each year today sees as much change as a few years in a previous century. And some day, younger generations will experience in a year what we today would have witnessed in a decade. The world continues speeding up, bearing us along with it, and in the tumult it is left to us to make sense of our own lives and construct our own stories within it.  Four stars. One taken off only because of the scope and ambition of the novel, which is only in rare circumstances done perfectly.","Bryan Zhang"
"“Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation. “  “The Years” by Annie Ernaux is a collection of memories. It is viewed as a memoir but rather than focusing on the private, as most memoirs do, its spotlight is the collective memory of a generation. The personal details of Ernaux life are just a tiny thread from the fabric of this book. The clear intention to keep the reader away from emotional involvement is rendered through the micro-stories of a woman who is the author herself but spoken of as a third person in the distant “she”. She, a peasant child of the 1940s, who later becomes a teacher and a writer. The highlights of her existence are told in fragments without much affection, almost as a documentary reportage running through sepia lens.  Parallel to that is the close observation of society, not exclusively dedicated to the French one, but pretty much all most significant events that have shifted history and culture, and have influenced the collective mindset. This part is told from the “we” perspective, demonstrating Ernaux’s involvement in all the processes that have taken place. Such approach of storytelling, reminiscing of ancient Greek chorus, acknowledges that she is part of history, while at the same time considering the little importance of her own life to the grand portrait of the world.  In the age of the me, my, and I, this rarity of self-distancing is quite fascinating, to say the least.","Antonia"

"Breathless, incantatory lists of objects, ads, desires, household appliances, feelings, headlines, movie titles, books, media figures, philosophers and intellectuals, polls, smalltalk topics, a history of intertwined personal and collective memories merging and melding.  A sociology of the rise of a consumer society bookmarked by key political events and a growing awareness of the growing tide of immigrants and their French children and grandchildren: ...an inner colony we no longer controlled There is a faint echo of José Ortega y Gasset's “Yo soy yo y mis circunstancias” in her highly original approach, when she states: [I]n her book she would like to save everything that has continually been around her. She wants to save her circumstance[...] So her book's form can only emerge from her complete immersion in the images from her memory in order to identify, with relative certainty, the specific signs of the times, the years to which the images belong, gradually linking them to others; to try to hear the words people spoke, what they said about events and things, skim it off the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we are and what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope [...] By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. [...] She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility[....] It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life. An outpouring, but suspended at regular intervals by photos and scenes from films that capture the successive body shapes and social positions of her being.”[p. 146] The book is not just lists, the lists fit together and snap shut with striking metaphors, images and metaphors. This is how Ernaux describes the end of the millenium years: The twentieth century closed behind us is a pitiless succession of end-of-millenium reviews. Everything was listed, classified, and assessed, from works of art and literature to wars and ideologies, as if the twenty-first century could only be entered with our memories wiped clean. It was a solemn nd accusatory time (we had everything to answer for). It hung darkly overhead and removed personal memories of what for us had never been an entity called “the century”but only a slipping-by of years that stood out (or didn't) depending on the changes they had brought to our lives. Written from a very French but extremely readable and intelligible femenine/feminist perspective, this is the author has to say about the rise to power and early years of Putin, made more intelligible by France's ambivalent and changing love-hate view of the USSR and the USA just before 9/11: An icy little man of fathomless ambition, with a name that for once was easy to pronounce, Putin, had replaced the drunken Yeltsin and swore to hunt down Chechens and “bump them off, even on the crapper”. Now Russia evoked neither hope nor fear, only perpertual desolation. It had withdrawn from our imaginations, which in spite of ourselves were occupied by the United States, a gigantic tree spreading its branches over the face of the earth. We were increasingly irritated by the Americans'moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was “arrogance”. They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar. Their values and principles -don't rely on anyone but yourself- gave hope to no one but them, while we dreamed of “another world” The last section is very critical of hypercapitalism, to use Gilles Lipovetsky's term: Everything in existence, air, heat, cold, grass, ants, sweat, and snoring, generated merchandise and products for the upkeep of the latter, ad infinitum, in an unrelenting subdivision of reality and proliferation of objects. The commercial imagination knew no bounds. It co-opted for its own gain all the specialty languages, ecological, psychological, etc. It draped itself in humanism and social justice, enjoined us to “fight the cost of living,” issued prescriptions such as “Spoil yourself”and “Get yourself a sweet deal.”[...] It was a sweet and happy dictatorship that no one contested. One needed only to protect oneself from its excesses, educate the consumer (the primary definition of the individual) [...] It was normal for goods to arrive from all over the world and freely circulat, while men and women were turned away at the borders. To cross them, some had themselves locked into trucks, inert merchandise, and died asphyxiated when the driver forgot them in a Dover parking lot under the June sun. and the virtuality of the Internet world: On the Internet all one needed do was enter a keyword and thousands of “sites”would leap on the screen. They delivered scraps of sentences and snatches of text that drew us toward other lucky finds in a thrilling treasure hunt. Real gems were thrown back into the infinity of things we hadn't been looking for. It seemed as though we could seize knowledge whole, enter the multiplicity of views flung onto blogs in a new and brutal languge [...] The Internet engineered the dazzling transformation of the world into discourse [...] The web was the royal way for the remembrance of things past.[p. 135] In the end, she sums up the characteristic current discourse style in a pithy epitaph: In all this lively exchange, no one had the patience to tell stories. An outstanding and extremely original contemporary memoir worth savouring in detail.","Alejandro Teruel"
"I'm not much of a Francophile and have never really holidayed there and will admit to having never heard of this author prior to her being shortlisted for this book for the International Booker in 2019 and winning the Nobel for Literature in 2022 and my book club chose it for its monthly read. Also I am not a fan of memoir or creative non-fiction. The Booker folk must have thought there was enough fiction in this to qualify but perhaps not enough to win. It has a very strange "we" voice with occasional lapses and even when it enters the third person it it referring to the girl , then young woman, in various photographs. This creates a weird sense of collective and individual in which to look back at their/her life experience from 1941 to the 21st century through a very nostalgic lens voiced as lists of events, things encountered . These lists of brand names, movies, music, politicians, historical events, social upheavals etc one level provoke the reader to think of the equivalents in their own lives, but after a while begin to feel like a bad history lesson. I found this wallowing in nostalgia, with little in the way of storyline or plot to be overwhelming. Combine this with the remoteness of the main character which the voice and style of writing creates I was just not engaged by the book. I persevered for half of it then really could not go on. It may well appeal to readers of memoirs and readers more in tune with all things French. Whereas brand names can usually be transmuted into those from ones one country many non-French readers may feel at a loss to relate to with regard to French Politics of the De Gaulle era, the Algerian war. I'm left with the feeling that the audience who will love this book is quite specific and does not include me .","Sheila"
"I Loved this!!! Adam David's review pretty much sums is up, so I'm going to quote from it, "What a fabulous collage of life - Ernaux melds history, feminism, and pop culture with snippets from her own experience since the 1940s, casting her life into sharp relief through a combination of imagery and analysis. The book accumulates as it goes, picking up speed as life accelerates - the 90s blip by in a way the tumultuous 60s in Paris don't. The contexualization of life with history is jarring - proof with relative time - and the book is uniquely effective. Though it has its slowness, I looked forward to reading this every day."  I turn 62 in a couple days and it hit a tender spot in a lovely way.","Helen"
"I loved this book, though at times it was very hard to relate to the details and pop culture references that come from the context of growing up and living in France in a certain point in time.  Still it encompases a chaotic experience of growing up a woman very eloquently and speaks for a whole, if not a couple of, generations.  It does so by juxtaposing global and personal, intimate histories. It feels like opening a box woth old family photos, but from many people all at once. This results in a beautiful, collage-like book that is at once very specific and universal, like she is indeed, every woman.","Nada"
"Um. Can we talk?  This book is brilliant and lively and lovely and full and it gives you a little closer on how to read the book now that you have read it and I never want to buy another product again and I probably want to go out buy the whole oeuvre of her work just like everyone else now that she has won the Nobel and that was damn deserved.","Erin"

"This didn’t trap me. It might be context-relevant for the mainstream, and (white/bourgeois) feminist… at the same time, I didn’t engage with the form (while it tries to evoke perspective via the usage of pronouns that aren’t the first person, it is still absolutely clearly an autobiography), also not radical enough for its time as other works by progressive women.

"Ernaux Season. Day 15. Final day.  A Chekhov quote at the beginning of the book. It sets the mood for the rest of the journey:   Yes. They’ll forget us. Such is our fate, there is no help for it. What seems to us serious, significant, very important, will one day be forgotten or will seem unimportant. And it’s curious that we can’t possibly tell what exactly will be considered great and important, and what will seem petty and ridiculous [...]. And it may be that our present life, which we accept so readily, will in time seem strange, inconvenient, stupid, not clean enough, perhaps even sinful…   Ernaux’s best work, I believe. Poetic (and nothing short of a coincidence) that I finish with this. You could read this and have a sense of everything that she is about, or you could come to it at the end of a period of bingeing her works and be able to identify every single sentence for a broader story, explored elsewhere. Alison Strayer asks in her translator’s note: “Is this Ernaux’s Remembrance of Things Past, or her Gone with the Wind, Life and Fate, with perhaps a nod to Virginia Woolf: the stream of consciousness, the struggle with the “I”...?” Yes, pretty damn close. I spent a long time with Ernaux’s words, which are contained in a world of not-quite-memoir, not-quite-fiction, not-quite-sociology, not-quite-kama-sutra. Throughout this time, I felt like I came to know her, appreciating what it is to dedicate a life to writing. I got a sense of what it means to give freely of yourself, putting it all down, attempting to reach a broad audience and a later generation through capturing the minutiae of the mundane. I let the commonplace themes wash over me, again and again. Every corner I turned brought me face to face with a familiar image: Ernaux’s struggle with class, initially refusing to accept that she could be the daughter of two people who owned and operated a café-grocery; her poor treatment of these parents in her own mind, but the poor treatment of her by her parents; a flight into purely physical, sexual fancies, still draped in Romanticism, all to escape class and parents; the war in Algeria; her periods; her abortion; her affairs. Ultimately, for her, it all culminated in a strong, overwhelming desire to belong. To achieve a certain status as a person, then to be.  I read lots of pieces from all over the place in the wake of Ernaux’s Nobel prize win, taking notes throughout exploring. Call it laziness, call it a knack for curation, but they give it all a sense of legitimacy and do her works a lot more justice than I could. Here are some of the best tidbits from what I read.  Dwight Garner’s piece in the NYT likened Ernaux to someone else that I am reading at the moment, which made me happy: “Like the poet Louise Glück, who won the Nobel in 2020, hers is a voice of rough compassion. Each looks out levelly at the world; each derives maximum effect from a minimum of words.” He also referred to her “direct” style: “Ernaux has characterized her language as “brutally direct, working-class and sometimes obscene.” She has an antagonism toward what she has called “the French tradition of the polished sentence, of ‘good taste’ in literature.”” I sat up and took note of something I hadn’t noticed without having had it sketched out for me: “You sense her influence in the austere, astringent work of many so-called autofiction writers, notably Rachel Cusk and Sheila Heti.” Yep. No wonder I took a liking to her.  I always love hearing what Sam Sacks has to say when he puts out his weekly reviews on the WSJ website. He calls Ernaux an “heir to Proust”, saying that “Ms. Ernaux, in contrast, casts a colder eye on her life and background, utilizing the clinical tools of, in her words, “attention to detail, use of a descriptive past tense, analysis of events.”” He mentions that “her books confront the deaths of her parents, her earliest sexual experience, her abortion at the age of 23 and her midlife love affair with a boorish younger man - subjects of supercharged emotion that she presents with studied distance and hard-earned objectivity.” Yet, in a way, Sam disagrees with Dwight Garner’s comparison of Ernaux to Cusk and Heti, at least a tiny bit: “The rigor and refinement of her method means that care must be taken with the claim that her victory also serves to valorize the popular current trend of autofiction. Ms. Ernaux’s books are made of sterner stuff than most contemporary memoir-novel hybrids, which typically stress the “otherness” of the author, bring to the surface some repressed trauma, and function in a way not dissimilar to therapy sessions. But Ms. Ernaux’s writing is not confessional as much as documentary. Writing as “an ethnologist of myself,” as she put it, she has been able to endow private experience with wider significance, creating the uncanny sense among her readers - until now, a small but fervent circle - that she has spoken for them, too. The “I” in her books is a setting as well as a person, a physical place - in this case a woman’s body - where events of psychological, social and political consequence occur.”  Sheila Heti herself jumps into the mix, writing a guest spot for the NYT. As I mentioned, Ernaux’s writing is dripping with class consciousness - as Heti puts it, “Ms. Ernaux has written that her aversion to playing with metaphors comes from an allegiance to her parents. She doesn’t want to write in a way that is different from how the people she grew up with speak.” In The Years, “the main character is no longer her or her family but time itself… Ms. Ernaux presents time as something onto which, if just for a moment, the detritus of civilization attaches; it favors no one thing over anything else. Time leaves behind world wars as lightly as it leaves behind the greatest movie stars, sexual mores, one’s parents, grandparents, children.” [Also, Alan interjects here to say: Sheila! What the fuck! Don’t change the spelling just because you’re writing for NYT. Say it loud and proud and Torontonian: F A V O U R] “The beautiful form of The Years is utterly its own, and I find it hard to think of a book more moving. She shows that humans are not their insides but their props and their settings. It is reassuring to imagine the self or the soul as something eternal, but it is harder to think that of a can of peas. It is a resolute - yet somehow euphoric - book about mortality, about how everything is always being lost to time, often without our even noticing it.”  Perhaps the best place to start for those are curious about Ernaux (and for some reason) don’t want to jump into primary material) is Alexandra Schwartz’s article for The New Yorker, in the November 21st issue, published online as Annie Ernaux Turns Memory Into Art. A quick glance at the books, a quick history lesson, a discussion with Ernaux herself. She mentions “in the course of her nearly fifty-year career, Ernaux has published more than twenty books. The first few were what you and I would call autobiographical novels: the protagonists, young women to whom Ernaux lent her own thoughts and experiences, are clearly self-portraits. Pretty soon, though, Ernaux pulled down the scrim of fiction and adopted the first person. Her “I” is not a put-on, some coy invitation to the reader to try to untangle what is real from what is false. Ernaux works exclusively from the factual material of life - her life.”  And as I have mentioned countless times now, this excavation of her own life leaves the reader a plethora of lasting memories and images. For me, another image from The New Yorker, illustrated by Sébastien Plassard. Its impact has remained - a final image of mother in her home, seared into the brain, residing in a place of calm, peace, nostalgia - the meadows of melancholy memory.      Quotes:  “We discovered the joys of order. Our melancholy at seeing a personal project fade into the distance – painting, writing, or making music – was compensated by the satisfaction of contributing to the family project.”  “At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we’re told to think – no less by books or ads in the Métro than by funny stories – are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but cannot name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.”  “Her main concern is the choice between “I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust.”  “And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”  “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”  “This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen – perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unarmed, such as the one that is making her write.”","Alan"
"What does a long life mean today? Looking back on a long life, what do our memories say about these times, our communities, our ideas, our choices?

"The book starts with rapid descriptions of pictures. Took me a while to get into that format. A bit further on the story becomes more cohesive and gives in my opinion a better overview of the times.The narration on audible really helped make the story come alive. Unfortunately the book never really grabbed me.","The Bookish SAHM"
"I began Les Années more enthralled than I thought I would be. By the halfway mark, though, I found myself bored and annoyed by turns and left with little desire to read to the end. I found Ernaux's reflections on ageing and the sudden passage of time quite touching, how words like 'quarante' or 'retraite' suddenly appear and catch us off guard. In this respect I thought the book well crafted, as if it had managed to simulate how our memories work. I enjoyed some of the societal critique - especially about phones, hypermarkets and sprawling and soulless suburban development - but much of it felt so unoriginal and obvious, and at times the novel turns into a predictable and worn-out catalogue of right-thinking idées reçues and clichéd events.  Not that there is anything wrong with this per se, but it was dispiriting to watch Ernaux's political concerns - rather like her life itself - drift along in a state of vapid indifference and ghostlike nothingness. Perhaps our heroine's indifference to all that life has thrown at at her is entirely the point of this self-proclaimed new type of autobiography, but I struggled to feel anything for her at all. And what about all of the other characters? She might mention again and again how much she wanted to write like Proust, but at least he created a world populated by the thoughts and feelings of the people that surround his narrator: in The Years, Ernaux's family are even more insubstantial than herself. I'm left far more excited to read a tell-all memoir from her ex-husband than any of her other books...  I recently watched an interview with Ernaux in which she claimed her detractors are just those that haven't read her. Well, at least now I can claim to no longer be among their number. The book would be a good introduction to the major social changes and historical events of the last several decades and of one woman's life within them, but it's hard to get quite so excited when we know all of these things already. Perhaps her imaginary reader from 2070 will be more kind.","Monty"
"Although this is a translation it is still an excellent read. It is tough going at the start - trying to get used to the French references (there are many allusions to popular culture, politics and food). However, stick with it and you will understand why Annie Ernaux was awarded the Nobel Prize this year. This is my first book to read of hers and it will not be the last. I am Irish and we have James Joyce and Ulysses - the French now have their own equivalent. Treat the book kindly and it will reward you.","Fergal O'Byrne"

"Excellent.  Annie Ernaux is only 19 years older than I, so the memories she lays down about events are contemporaneous to my memories. The measured, non-author'd fiction of her life and the world's events are non-climatic, normal. Structured only by time. Events happen and other events move us on. Beautiful presentation of a life. A presentation that we can learn from.  Edited, authored, fiction chooses specific messages to leave us with; presented toward a climax that makes a point. That is not how life occurs.  A major attraction for me was the point of view is female, and French. Neither of these two POVs do I run across often. Unhidden, unashamedly, different. When I read, especially literature in translation, this is what I want - a different point of view. I can relive my own memories at will; living someone else's, whether as a memoir or as fiction, is exciting.  Now that she has the Nobel Prize, much has been written about her and her approach (better than I can).   ","Robert Swanson"
"A tale for the times, a collective experience. Although this is set in France and some of the particulars are not very familiar to me (Rainbow Warrior is), there is a progression of time and experience, of encroaching capitalism and urban sprawl and ambivalent attitudes towards events and others that is certainly one I can share.","Jill Schroeder"
"Kind of like Mad Men with a female protagonist, a strange and often lovely narrative of a life unfolding within the tumult of the 20th century. Hard to get into but once I got into the flow I fell into the story and enjoyed it.","Jesse Coker"
"Brilliant! ‘With the mingled excitement and powerless one feels on discovering a truth about oneself in a book.’","Jillian"
"The lack of dialog and scene made this book a more difficult read. Ernaux writes the big picture events that occur during each stage of her life - political and cultural - but she writes in the royal "we" or the third person, so I felt distanced from her as a memoirist. While I understand why she would win a Nobel Prize, she left me cold.","Mirinda Kossoff"
"I felt like the author went through the newspaper archives at her local library in France, picked out 5 or 10 items from each year starting in 1940 and wrote a book. She probably threw in a few entries from her diaries. Maybe I should try another title by her because this one left me cold.","Sandy"
"Definitely, the best book I read this year. The comments here speak for themselves. Although I had no common memory or stand concerning many things that happened in France, I felt I could relate to more than I expected. We are more bound to one another than we believe. Such a pure and beautiful book","Aasecat"
"“At these moments she thinks that her life could be drawn at two intersecting lines: one horizontal, which charts everything that has happened to her, everything she’s seen or heard at every instant, and the other vertical, with only a few images clinging to it, spiraling down into darkness.”","Adam"
"Really enjoyed. Story would have moved me more if the structure/form was more traditional; there was enough content, cues, references to keep the reader glued. That said, I understand why Ernaux elected to write in that way - to invoke the passage of time etc etc…","Helena Eatock"
"There seems to be a collection of books about women that has run parallel to my life. This is the one for a time of change, becoming, and navigating the next steps of adulthood. It is profoundly wise, but a challenging work of art, best swallowed, sat with during long stretches of time, until my feet get sore from sitting cross-legged and the words, images, and the phrases make up every nerve and movement of my fingers. If there is one reason to learn French it is to read this book how Ernaux wrote it. The structure is so important to how the novel carries weight, a motion of its own. To read it in translation cheapened the effect, I am sure, no matter the diligence of the translators. About the structure—it had its own internal mimesis, self-referential because the praxis of writing is something Ernaux tags to the essence of her French culture. I love how she would mention that she wanted to write this very thing we are holding as readers, but it is nestled in the folds of pages describing her life thirty years prior to when it was published. There is a diligence to her that feels very hopeful, for we so often saw things that we never get around to doing. The Years is an antidote to solipsistic narcissism, and it made me finally understand why Virginia Woolf is so against the individual writing about themselves in their novels. Annie Ernaux achieved the impossible here! Capturing the essence of generations, skimming the froth of politics, culture, how a child grows their limp flesh to the muscle of adolescence, it is all contained like a sprinting figure which the brain perceives in short frames, clear blots and images and then a blur of years pass in front of our eyes. It is a magical experience to read these journalistic-in-tone, poetry-in-construction paragraphs (albeit some poorly constructed sentences that may be because of the translation). The most gripping paragraph that I've read in all of literature recently was about the formation of silent undercurrents in public discourse isolating individuals who feel it, and when it comes to fruition it is worked through by the people while new silences grow. In all our discussions about societal failings, mental health, etc. etc. on social media, where it is easy to be seen for our shared humanity and shared traumas, I am comforted to know that it never really satisfies the need to be understood. What an abstraction to put so deftly—I am deeply impressed.  I declare, in the midst of learning languages, that the reason I learn French is for Ernaux.","Saachi"

"An absolutely astounding memoir of life and culture in France from 1941-2006. The back cover of my English translation quotes Deborah Levy “one of the best books you’ll ever read”. I certainly agree.","David Weiss"
"While I could not relate to Ernaux's tales about her childhood and plentiful references to French politics and culture, I resonated with The Years's universal themes, from its concerns about our relationship to the past to the anxieties that come with progress; it was easy to do so because I could sense the honesty and humility in Ernaux's ambition to "[retrieve] the memory fo collective memory in an individual memory", to "capture the lived dimension of History". I particularly enjoyed Ernaux's signature rhythm of continuity, which sounds like a low and constant hum and parallels that progression of time, that "palimpsest" sensation that Ernaux most wants to capture.","Angelica"
""We were mutating. We didn't know what our new shape would be. The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet towards other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die."  In THE YEARS, Annie Ernaux (as translated by Alison Strayer) explores the most personal features of memory, space, and time through the lens of history of not just France but of the whole world, a fitting proof that all life is political and that the political is personal.  The book is part memoir and part analysis of the ever changing society, marked by the products and pleasures people consume in different periods from 1941 to 2006. But I believe at the heart this is the realization that to understand oneself is to understand what’s happening around. The book is a contribution to the school of thought that a person is a product of multitudes of external factors, unconsciously or not. Personal narrative, as she said, is part of societal narrative.  Ernaux’s commentaries on society were flawlessly stitched into her personal memories of life growing up in France, leaving no feeling of being detached to the world. I love the honesty and the rawness of her prose and ideals, especially when she never shies away from admitting when she doesn’t understand things. It takes a certain level of confidence – or maybe more of certainty? – to be this honest in the face of neverending pressure from society.  I understand though that this book might not be for everyone. I struggled a bit going through some pages, especially as Ernaux tended to fixate on the most mundane yet still use the most complicated of sentences. But still there is something calming about THE YEARS. Maybe it’s the thought that time is a construct and we all have our expiration dates. That’s some comfort amid the chaos of life: “She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. But there is nothing.” ","Jodesz Gavilan"
"This is a powerful memoir that takes us beyond one person's existential overindulgent angst (which is what most memoirs are) and meta-analyzes her past for all to consider. And yes, if you are from Europe or North America and a middle to high socio-economic status you will feel her and recognize yourself even if you land within 20 years of her age. This is both the strength and the "I wonder" moment about the book. Loved it in many ways but wondered about the missed perspectives. It is a memoir though so...","MaryEllen Ruddell"
"really excellent  “Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fos- tered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age; if that is so, what kind of memory can be ascribed to this girl in the second row? Maybe she has no memory except that of the previous summer, almost bereft of images - the incorporation of a missing body, a man's. Two future goals coexist inside her: (1) to be thin and blonde, (2) to be free, autonomous, and useful to the world. She dreams of herself as Mylène Demongeot and Simone de Beauvoir.”  “No sign of the heaviness of existence she must tear herself away from to master the language of philos- ophy, serve the injunction of essence and the categorical imperative, subjugate the body, repress the desire for food and the obsession with the monthly blood that no longer flows. Reflect on the real so it will cease to be real, become an abstract thing - intangible, a product of intelligence. A few weeks later, she will stop eating, buy Néo-Antigrès fat-burning pills, and be reduced to pure consciousness. After class, when she walks up boulevard du Marne, past the funfair booths, the howl of the music follows her like calamity.”  “She ofien revisits images of herself single, in the streets of cities where she has walked and in the rooms she has occupied -in a young ladies' hostel in Rouen, in Finchley as an au pair or a penzione on via Servio Tullio, on holiday in Rome. These are her selves, it seems to her, who continue to exist in these places. In other words, past and future are reversed. The obiect of desire is not the future but the past; she desires to be back in the room in Rome, in the summer of 1963. In her journal she writes: 'Out of extreme narcissism, I want to see my past set down on paper and in that way, be as I am not' and ‘There's a certain image of women that torments me. ‘“  “In those rooms, she never sees herself with the clarity of photos, but blurred as in a film on an encrypted TV channel. Or she sees a silhouette, a hair-stvle, movements - leaning out of a window, washing her hair - and positions - sitting at a desk or lying on a bed. Sometimes she manages to feel she is back inside her former body, not the way one is in dreams, but more as if she were inside the glorious body' of the Catholic religion, which was supposed to resurrect after death with no sensation of pain or pleasure, heat, cold, or the urge to urinate. She doesn't know what she wants from these inventories, except maybe through the accumulation of memories of objects, to again become the person she was at such and such a time. She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.”  “There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition, but now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"A hybrid book, a historic book, a biography, a documentary, a chronicle, all these can be seen in each page of the book! And it really doesn't matter what you consider it as the book doesn't claim any of these. It is a unique writing and the only thing it claims is its uniqueness. Ernaux is multi disciplinary, versatile author. She is writing, like in poetry, her thoughts before rationalization. The effect of this is that you feel the events and the periods that she is describing rather than reading an account or description of the period. You mostly feel the period rather than learning about the period. At the end you have an honest engagement in a period of time you may have not lived because is before you while the repercussions of that period affected you, or, and this is a guess, if you have lived during that time and in those places, it offers you an alternative understanding of what was happening around you. In each case you are a witness of a unique human account of the history of human beings.","Eleftherios"
"Wow. Tells the story of a generation of women by telling one woman’s story, from growing up as a baby boomer in the shadow of WW2, to the enlightenment of the 1960s, everything that once was taboo becoming acceptable, progress and commercialism. The style is detached yet intimate, told through photos and images that evoke memories. Unlike anything I’ve ever read before.","Deb Barnes"
"If you're interested in history or just want to get a sense of how society has evolved over the years, then this book is definitely worth a read. Just be prepared for a slow and introspective journey through the banalities of life.  The Years is a unique and thought-provoking book that follows one woman's journey through life as she navigates the ups and downs of everyday experiences.  On the one hand, Ernaux's writing is vivid and detailed, bringing the mundane aspects of life to life in a way that is truly captivating. Whether it's grocery shopping or family dinner, she manages to infuse even the most ordinary events with a sense of wonder and introspection. On the other hand, some readers may find the slow pace and focus on everyday events to be tedious and uninteresting.  However, it's important to note that The Years is not just a simple tale of one woman's life. It's also a rich and enlightening exploration of how society has changed over the course of several decades, from the end of World War II to the year 2000. Ernaux masterfully weaves together her own personal experiences with the larger historical events of the time, giving readers a unique and intimate look at how these events have impacted our world.  On a side note, I like how this quotation speaks to the sense of change and transformation that is often associated with youth, and the feeling of stagnation and immobility that can come with age:  "Unlike her teenage years when she was certain that she was not the same from one year, or even one month, to the next, while the world around her remained unchanging, now it is she who feels immobile in a running world."","Diane"
"A book with a big reputation, but which I found somewhat flat perhaps because it requires such a detailed knowledge of French popular culture and post-war political life, a lot of which went over my head. I think, too, that the much vaunted stylistic innovation of this work should perhaps be considered in relation to, say, Joan Didion. And, let us add, at least one other, Murray Bail (he. 2021), have done it better since. Still, with its fragmented memory anchored on photographs The Years has its moments and manages “to save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Yuri Sharon"
"Lovely. The collective judgements mostly feel representational and accurate and fair, even to this reader, born of a different generation and never a French citizen. The reflections on capitalism and consumer culture are highlights, as are those on sex/pleasure/desire. Enjoyable and engaging throughout. Although I never really felt awed by the depth of insight or creativity or any other particular literary achievement. As pleasingly melancholy as an early Leonard Cohen song.","Daniel Schulof"
"This is a most remarkable piece of writing. It is not a novel, it is not an autobiography.

"This book follows the trajectory of my life, just a few years later in its beginnings and on another continent. Poignant yet deeply perceptive of the past and what it brings to the present, or not. I would appreciate reading this alongside someone fluent in French to assist with untranslated terminology and titles.","Zoë"
"I cannot sufficiently recommend this masterful book. It is really a before-and-after event for me. The story of the author is the story of France is the story of the postwar period in Europe. Though the emphasis seems detached and sociological, it also feels very intimate and personal. What a wonderful way to tell a story!  There are loads of references to people, events, etc. which may make it difficult to read. My knowledge of post-war French politics is not too bad, but even with half the references missing it is not really an obstacle to a growing fascination with the accounts, and as they become more contemporary, and therefore more familiar, they also do not loose their poignancy, their critical sharpness and richness.  And so, even if you don´t know much about contemporary French history, you must read this book. ","Juan"
"This is a beautifully written book.","Joselle Carrillo"
"Annie Ernaux's classic pulls off what in a logline sounds impossible: a memoir that fuses one woman's life with the collective memory of a French generation. She does this with highly specific details that speak to a whole milieu, and the translation loses none of her exquisitely poetic writing. I enjoyed its lens into the societal transformations within just a lifetime, most notably the country's leap from Catholic conservatism to the liberal attitudes it is now known for, and how they charted the author's own course from a married mother to an author with lovers and adult children.  This premise inherently assumes some extent of shared perspective, and toward the end I felt a little irritated by some of the sweeping political generalizations, especially since they are fairly predictable ones. ","Justina"
"Kind of disappointing. Reading it was like going through random notes on scraps of paper, bills, book titles, names, events... - all chaotic and not making much sense. Details are just overwhelming. There is this central figure of a woman, she is so important because she is experiencing it all - but, still, it doesn't really mean much to a reader, I just read her as somebody so preocuppied with herself. I don't know about the original but in a Polish translation the narrator reffered as "she" feels very artificial.","Magda"

"It’s definitely a hard read if you’re not familiar with French culture and history. However, I would’ve probably given it 5 stars if I was French myself. It’s a beautifully written memoir, that’s put together from snippets of history and personal life memories. It takes you through a whole lifetime of one woman living in France and tells you history from a unique angle. The writing is quite eccentric, probably not to everyone’s taste. I also specifically enjoyed feminist thoughts of the main character throughout the book.  Here are two of my favorite quotes:  "At times, she feels weighed down by the quantity of her learning. Her body is young and her thinking is old. In her diary she writes that she feels 'hypersaturated with all-purpose ideas and theories, that she is 'looking for another language and 'longs to return to an original purity'. She dreams of writing in a language no one knows. Words are 'little embroidery stitches around a tablecloth of night'. Other sentences contradict this lassitude: I am a will and a desire'. She does not say for what."  "I'm afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it."","Eliza Saftyuk"
"An emotional history of the modern world","Charlie Lincoln"

"“So her book’s form can only emerge from her complete immersion in the images from her memory in order to identify, with relative certainty, the specific signs of the times, the years to which the images belong, gradually linking them to others; to try to hear the words people spoke, what they said about they said about events and things, skim it off the mads of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings of what we are and we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope.” The author described what she set out to do and did so brilliantly in describing the events in her life, from the macro, WW Ii and the destruction of the World Trade Center, to the micro, a holiday dinner with her sons and their partners or shopping at a hypermarket. The allusions to figures or events in France alluded me (too lazy to look them all up) but that did not detract from the feelings that this book evoked in me. Don’t we all have memories of family dinners, but I am unable to capture them in the evocative language of this author.","Louis Giancola"
"The best","Kassy Lee"
"The form is the thing: the richness in the innovation but also the innovation's weakness.  As she lays out the objects, events, years...I found three types of responses in myself: There were names/events/things that I remember and have my own memories of -- like the 45 of Joe Dassin that I own and sang with; there were names/events/things that I could imagine as she told them -- like the deaths of famous people; and then there were times when there was no overlap between her narrator's memory and mine.  What I like is the premise that there is nothing private. That all memories are of a "we" and never rooted in a singular "I". There is something very structural in her method but a structure with particulars.  But what I miss is the narrative voice that creates the arc. There IS an arc in the book as a whole. But what I want something that connects the life "we" lived. The effect of the book is as if memory were recorded in pixels. What I want is the pixels AND an overall picture with its meaning.  So the form is innovative and even mind blowing -- if you have the patience to stick with it, like a Steve Reich composition. But form is also limiting in that it, unlike a Steve Riech composition, it under expresses its potential divinity. I don't know if I could read/listen to another book like this.","Naeem"
"4.75/5  A worthwhile read that triggers contemplation.  The ability to translate a work like this, specifically from French to English, is a feat deserving of an award; much praise to Strayer.  4.75, and not 5.00, because I felt the last ten pages, where the book itself was explained, took away from the beauty of the artwork itself. The entire book is a sort of dual autobiography, constantly alternating between a story of the author herself, and a collective autobiography of France and/or women in France. By spending the last ten pages discussing the inspiration/design/inception of the book, the perspective snaps exclusively to Ernaux's and we lose the collective point of view. In addition, it's always nice to go behind the scenes and see how and why iconic art was made, but I would prefer that the pulling back of the curtain on this book's creation not be part of the artwork itself.  Then again, this book won a Nobel Prize and I'm just an idiot with a keyboard. You should read this.","Farid Medleg"
"I read a quarter of this in 2019 when it was longlisted and subsequently shortlisted for the Booker International Prize. I had no idea who Ernaux was. I thought that there were too many references going over my head to actually take it all in. So I didn't. I returned it to the library thinking that I'd eventually get to it even though the likelihood of that seemed to dwindle in my mind. But I kept thinking about Ernaux's voice. Starting a novel/memoir/history/sociological text with "All the images will disappear" felt like a moment of bracing confidence. Imagine starting a book about memory with that and then following it up with a short paragraph about a woman pissing outside. There's a rye humor, a lack of sentimentality, a desire to record, a need to witness.  I bought a copy in 2020 without having read any of Ernaux's other works. I just felt over time like I needed to own it for some reason. I read the first twenty pages again, and it moved me. Even though I still didn't know many of the French points of reference, I felt like I understood then that it didn't actually matter. That the point is that so many French readers wouldn't understand every single reference unless they were of her generation. That her living memory had already begun to die in the minds of younger generations of French people. That all the images will, in fact, disappear.  In lieu of reading it after buying a copy, I realized that she references her own body of work indirectly throughout The Years. So I thought, why not read most, if not all, those earlier works to meet Ernaux where I can. So I did. And although it isn't essential, I think I made the right choice.  Her body of work pre-The Years engages with her family, her struggle with class, her social mobility, her backstreet abortion, her sexual liaisons, her various senses of shame, her inexorable drive to learn, her propensity for observation. It's all, as memoirs are, about Annie (excluding/even including some semi-autobiographical novels). In one of her novels, A Frozen Woman, Ernaux turns her transition from academic liberation to marital confinement into a universal depiction of womanhood in the 50s/60s. She generalizes while centering her personal narrative.  And that's where The Years comes in. Ernaux works through her life from 1940 to 2006, including references to almost all of the material she has written about prior. But it is no redux. She writes about her observations in the first-person plural while including references to her life via ekphrastically described photographs/videos at various stages and describing herself with a persistent third-person "she." The work then becomes a catalog of French cultural moments, historical happenings, and becomes something that I genuinely believe has never been written before, to my knowledge: a novel that actively bridges personal, cultural, national, and global history so as to write a memoir of a collective generation. I don't know how to describe it to really do it justice. It's free-flowing, free-wheeling yet never overly chaotic. Dexterous yet restrained. It feels like Ernaux assumes the role of successor to iconic 20th-century names like Woolf, Proust, and de Beauvoir without attempting to take on any of their stylistic flourishes. It's just all about time and memory and how everything is so important and unforgettable and yet it will be erased generation by generation and we are all living and will live lives defined by both perpetual stasis and relentless motion and we will just keep living until our past overtakes our future and the weight of history is weightless because in the end it becomes but a released puff of breath but it feels like a billion tons because almost nothing if anything feels as important.  The ending made me cry. I read chunks of it aloud to my parents, and I teared up again. It just felt so beautiful to me. In the face of time's decrepitude, Ernaux is courageous. Despairingly intelligent and brutally honest, and yet she's willing to salvage the unsalvagable.  In many ways, it's perfect as a book to read as the year comes to a close. Much to think about as time tolls on and the digit gets replaced. Happy New Year!","Gregory Duke"
"Ernaux very ably tracks a life from the first inchoate impressions and on through the years. Merging words, books, cinema, fashion, politics and giving us clear snapshots for all the years. Changing tone for the changing years.  I imagine the great amount of research undertaken to build up this book. I think that if I were French, I would have formed a greater connection to the book. As it is, most of the references flew right by me, so I lost a lot because of that. That and the aloofness she maintains throughout the book are I think what made me not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.  An ARC kindly provided by author/publisher Fitzcarraldo, via Netgalley.","Sofia"
"This didn’t resonate with me at all. Reflecting on the why:  Ernaux is around the age of my grandma and their lives probably started in quite similar post-war village style. Ok, only the gulags were very real here. Through the years, their storylines split in incredible way, it’s half a century of parallel lives, completely different. This unfairness bugs me always - that my parents and granparents couldn’t enjoy the same freedom and the problems that come with having freedom.  Then there’s a generational gap, which makes me read this book as some strange work of history, where events come one after another, some i’m aware of, some not, but mostly they give me a “meh” feeling. I can reason with myself that it’s incredible, how much changed in a lifetime, but so what.  The flow of time is a theme of many books, and French have their line starting with Proust (who reappears here too, with his Madeleines). I learned to love the flow of time by Proust. Recently I was surprised by how tasty and sensual is the flow of Duras. Here? Again, meh.  Maybe because the author tries to disconnect from herself and looks to her life from the observer point of view (but then, Proust was also a very much observer). There’s not much emotions - maybe because the author used up her feelings for earlier books. I found it dull, lacking of spices.  Or is it just my French and I didn’t read through a layer that was left for the native readers? In some books I easily recognise my limitations, here it doesn’t seem to be the case. As librarian said - the language is even too simplistic. Maybe that’s what bothered me.  On one podcast they’ve said Les Années is not the best book to start with, so maybe i should try some earlier ones. But then, French literature is full of authors i truly enjoy exploring. Maybe this one can wait until i retire, or smth ","Jorė"

"I nearly gave this one star because I’ve never been so simultaneously bored and interested by a book. The Years is both an autobiography of Annie Ernaux and a sort of cultural chronicle of France from the 1940s to 2008.  Every paragraph was a new thought/image/topic - all sharp and visceral, but the constant barrage quickly became exhausting. Ernaux talks about herself in the third person and about her generation/ the French people using the first person plural, which I also did not like and felt preachy.  I did like how the evolution of the country’s wider hopes, dreams and ideologies was interwoven with changes in the smallest details of daily life and the representations and actualities of sex in French culture.

"The text is loaded with french names, books, politics, history... I didn't understand a solid half od this book but what I admit is that it is definitely well written. I appreciate the concept of no characters, just a mass society of french. However it was kind of hard to sink into this world because I'm not french. What I cared about the most there is the women's position in the world changing through years.","Karolina Lewandowska"
"This is a strangely dispassionate but effective assembling of ‘history’ - the ‘slippery narrative’ of experience against a larger backdrop continually assessed, addressed, which, in turn, forms an intrinsic part of Ernaux herself.  This philosophical approach, at turns existentialist and Freudian will find its greatest devotees in lovers of French thought and culture - or at least old enough to recall many of the events described throughout its pages.  And fans of of Flaubert, Proust, de Beauvoir and Sagan will find the familiar overtones of regret and sadness that echo throughout French life-writing and literature.","Rosemary Atwell"

"What a project!! Gorgeous attempt to "capture the lived dimension of History...a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes" (228-9). Blown away by the scale of time (65 years!) and Ernaux's eye—insightful, self-critical, political. Documents the advent of "consumer society" and technological "progress" with particular aplomb. Excited to read more. Agree it's a masterpiece.","k-os"
"Personal Handwritten Notes — The dissolution of the ‘I’ into the ‘we’; we are all nameless by default. — For the impersonal to become personal, we must express ourselves freely. — Acquainting and thus expressing oneself through the films and the literature of the zeitgeist is perhaps the highest form of personal expression. — There is a lean emphasis on rebellion and counterculture. This seems to support postmodern thinking, but Ernaux still remains firmly rooted in her kin. — There is also a need to keep track of current events as a sign of ‘intellectual gentrification’. Out with the old; in with the new. This ensures that one’s freedom is not misguided. This is ironic because Ernaux also uses her freedom to masturbate to porn, though one may argue that it is her way of expressing her sexuality. — ‘New objects were no longer met with wonder or anxiety, but welcomed as additions to individual freedom and pleasure.’ — Although freedom entails active autonomy, there is a recumbent sort of lassitude acquainted with it—that it is, in one way or another, man’s eschatological state-of-being. Nothing comes out of it thereafter. — This freedom is further augmented by the fact that these objects are made for one’s own individual pleasure. For instance, one does not need to learn how to code in order to use a computer. Freedom is as personal as it is necessary. — ‘Nothing equaled the bliss at the end of the day, after elbowing one’s way with the first passengers into the crowded RER, and inching as close as possible to the center aisle seats, and standing for these stations, of finally sitting down and closing one’s eyes, or doing a crossword.’ — This freedom; however, is impermanent, for there remains the looming global threat of civil war that seems to have resurfaced after 9/11. Thus, in spite of the inert implications of personal expression, we are led to question whether one is truly free or simply a configuration of all and sundry forces as a consequence of this so-called ‘intellectual gentrification’. — ‘The time for sleep was past. We had to be alert until the end of time.’ — ‘There was a consensual falsity in the air.’ We are free but we acknowledge that this freedom may not last. — In lieu of this, we have configured reality in such a way that personal freedom is achieved by manipulating freedom such that it is attainable within the bounds of our own realities. Hence, freedom becomes reproducible and our conception of ‘we’ transforms into a multiplicity of singular, nondescript ‘I’s. — ‘We lived in a profusion of everything, objects, information, and “expert opinions”. No sooner had an event occurred than someone issued a reflection, whatever the subject: manners of conduct, the body, orgasm, and euthanasia. Everything was discussed and decrypted.’ — ‘With the intermingling of concepts, it was increasingly difficult to find a phrase of one’s own, the kind that, when silently repeated, helped one live.’ — Ernaux comes to the conclusion that one’s freedom—or personal expression—should not be thought of as a unique ‘I’ that exists differentiated in comparison to the larger populace, but as a replicated ‘I’ out of an impersonal ‘we’ that exists only as a function of depicting reality at its nth configuration. — ‘There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we”, as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.’ — The memoir—if it even can be called one—begins and ends in images, for what are we but spectators of reality?","Robbie Claravall"

"Book club book #29 The arc of a life - the author - and of the world from 1941 to 2006. Told mostly in the collective first person, a “we” that floats between “we the family”, “we a generation” and “we the people” - with parts in the third person. The effect is detached observation, like walking through a museum. Photos, videos, places, memories are described. The story is life, the emotions are “every person”, we get the odd sense of knowing everything about the author - and nothing. It is a grand narrative, condensed into 225 pages, that is elegantly, tightly written, but is hard to connect with emotionally except towards the end as her children have children, and she begins to confront death.","Niall O'neill"

I’m very excited to discuss it as there is much to discuss, and I’m glad my neighbor chose it as I loved the French authors perspective and writing style.

"This is a not really an autobiography, but a collective biography of the cultural, historical and societal changes that took place between 1940 and into almost present time, mostly in France/Europe. Very interesting, very masterful in the observations of details - some of which one can easily relate to: celebrities, heads of state, cultural phenomena, momentous events like the fall of the Berlin wall, etc. etc. Still, not an easy read and quite dry at times, in an endless repetition of one thing after another.","Carolina"
"Incredibly unique. Necessary to have a pen in hand. I see myself and so many other people that I know in these pages. It’s hard to rate this because I think it would have been much more delightful if I understood all of the cultural references—or spent the time researching, watching, and listening to them all.  “But one thing was certain: it would never again be possible to remember how the world had been before the night we lay with a naked body pressed to ours.”  ","Brooke Eubanks"
"I actually loved the distant, removed narrative that gives a sweeping panorama of France in the 20th to 21st century.

"The past is a foreign country  Ernaux contemplates her life throughout the second half of the 20th century and uses it as a narrative arc for the portrait of the generation of French women. Both Didier Eribon and Édouard Louis named Ernaux as their inspiration for describing their experience as class emigrants. However, I could see only traces of that theme in The Years. The focus here is less on class and more on female experience. The legalisation of abortion, 1968, normalisation of what was previously seen as aberration or immorality etc. are topics that Ernaux mentions. The writing itself resembled a series of brief notes, often using a lot of cultural references that would be hard to follow to anyone a) not growing up in France in the period or b) not deeply immersed in French culture already. The Polish translation helpfully provided numerous footnotes explaining the events and characters, but also correcting factual errors made by the author. It was an engaging read but nowhere as good as Returning to Reims.","Wej"
"I struggled with this book (literally struggling to stay awake reading it in the afternoon), until the years when the events described were within my own living memory. I feel I need to go back and reread the book, because it’s experimental and I didn’t understand the experiment until closer to it’s end.  Ernaux writes a piercing critique of capitalism and American imperialism, but also of French racism (so similar to British!) and the ineffectual nature of western democratic processes and movements like feminism.  I understand the trajectory of my own life better for having read this work. I now understand it as a masterpiece (mistresspiece?) and sense I’ll get even more from it when I reread it.","Helen Meads"
"A masterpiece! With this my take is that Ernaux creates a whole new genre that takes a few pages to get used to, but once you’re in it it connects you to the described images, the personal memories and the indirect reflections on society’s collective memory and experiences in a way that is both fascinating at times so spot on that it’s almost uncomfortable to read. There are so many great wordings and quotes that I will definitely have to read this again sometime just to relive and better remember those phrasings. Solid 5 stars.","Vilde Løvaas"
"This autobiography isn't the usual autobiography. It's concerned a lot more with how the subject fit into French society and how society shaped her than the actual events of her life. Someone called it the autobiography of her generation, which seems like an accurate description.  The author uses "we" and "she" instead of "I" and it has the effect of partially removing her from her own story. She also leaves out a lot of events from her own life (for example, she never mentions writing anything).  Ernaux writes incisively about memory, aging, personal freedom, and being a woman.","Wallyeast"
"I am very glad I read this book. It was insightful and necessary. Is it my favorite book? No. But is it important, yes. I found myself captivated in the last few chapters, appreciating her life and writing more.","Brynne Jensen"
"Another wonderful book by Ernaux. I loved the author’s long strings of historical or sociological observations. As my wife said to me, it’s somehow incredibly refreshing to see an author do away with all of the often unnecessary transition phrases we encounter so often. Here, there is no “therefore” or “however” or “nevertheless” or “on the other hand.” There is only the unrelenting flow of ideas. Of course, I also loved the powerful feminist insight that accrues from her close scrutiny of her body, her sexual life, her interactions with men, and her encounters with consumerism and policies related to abortion, etc. And it’s wonderful to compare her treatment of the flow of biographical or autobiographical time with Woolf’s and Proust’s and Lahiri’s.","Derek"
"#1of2023. Will read again. Many wonderful passages.","Kristin Stavnes"
"As much as one may enjoy omnipresent references to culture, politics, world events and all that buzz, once you get the hang of Ernaux writing you will know exactly how certain events and times will be depicted. It belittles the force of the narrative and sadly binds as towards banality at times (how many times have I read a similar account of May 68' or 9/11?).  Detachment of the narrator works wonders, however, the book, with its changing speed makes the guts churn (one of the wonders) as we are unwillingly becoming the ally of passing time while progressing with the book. Carefully constructed, painful and so mamy mixed feelings. The ending - a little rushed.","Ezra"
"“Sauver quelque chose du temps où l'on ne sera plus jamais.”― Annie Ernaux, Les Années.  I mean WOW. This IS a masterpiece memoir of French life. It is a uniquely genius autobiography, which can also be easily treated as a lesson in history and culture between 1940s and 2000s.  The book spans the timeframe from Ernaux’s birth in 1940 up to 2006, and moves from her working-class upbringing in Normandy to her years teaching French literature in a lycée, living in the Parisian suburb of Cergy, raising two sons and eventually divorcing.  However, it is not a straightforward autobiography; rather it is told in a collective “we”, which sometimes shifts into the third person, so the author appears as “she”. Ernaux shows it is possible to write both personally and collectively, situating her own story within the story of her generation, without ever confusing the two. She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.”  The memoir is comprised of Ernaux's own memories, of historical events, of scraps of popular culture, slang, notes on the subtle transformations of the culture.  In the memoir, we encounter the war in Algeria, Sartre and De Beauvoir, Edith Piaf’s “Les Amants d’un Jour,” fondue bourguignonne, Agnès Varda’s Le Bonheur, the pro-abortion rights manifesto of the 343 salopes, nuclear threat, the explosion of consumerism, unemployment, immigration, the advance of technology.   Truly genius.","Dilek Sayedahmed, Ph.D."
"A very interesting combination of auto biographical and historical pieces of France from 1940s forward. Told like a scrapbook: pictures cut from magazines, family photos, jingles from TV commercials, snips of conversation at the dinner table, sounds of a Vespa backfiring in the street, etc. I tired of it after awhile and not being born in France made reading much of it a chore. This is highly regional in my opinion and the copious sentences in French and obscure references to events only locals would understand left me disinterested.","Suzanne Zeitouni"
"I found it very hard to get through. If I had more connection to the country of France, I can see how cool it would be to read, what is in essence, the autobiography of a country if a country could write. To me the book lacked emotion, it felt very dry. The writing was beautiful, though.","Kyle Hepp"
"Beautifully authentic piece. It took me practically to the end to truly understand why Ernaux decided on this kaleidoscopically impersonal third person perspective. An understanding which perhaps is only truly earned retrospectively, rather than concurrently, with the text. For Ernaux life, the life of the “self,” belongs to a broader discourse, a greater unfolding and eventuating through which we are able to manifest - even if on uncertain terms - images, visions, of a shared essence.  4.5/5","Lucas"
"In 2022, it was a delight to discover the work of Annie Ernaux. I quickly fell in love with her crisp yet poetic prose and her vulnerable style of entangling memories.  So it was only fitting to start 2023 with The Years, Ernaux’s ambitious attempt to chronicle the years between 1941 and 2006 through memory, media and mundanity.  Inventing a new form referred to as ‘the collective autobiography,’ she captures the passing of time with fragments and snapshots. The Years is a slim book and Ernaux deftly glides between both precise moments and fleeting impressions. This captures the feeling of understanding what it was like to live then, whether through a political reference or a conversation between family or friends.  The way she takes us through a big historical event and simple domestic life on the same page is astounding. After all, when we look back on our lives, the most random things seem more real than the incidents in history books.  I particularly loved the recurring motif of how family meals have changed over the years. The tables may stay the same but people evolve, relationships evolve and conversations evolve as Ernaux grows from child to young woman to wife to mother.  I also loved how meta it was, as Ernaux reflects on her own images and videos and wonders who she was then. There’s also discussions of how to create the very text that you are reading, which I found fascinating.  This may be a work of sociology, but the lyricism and musings are always present.","Kamna"
"“Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one's wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express a supreme and precious commodity.”","Lucy Roth"
"A "restricted" style even more self-involved than Oulipo. A "world-weary," joyless Perec.  A kind of faux-naïveté relating a presumed "collective memory". The author is constantly visible, peeking over the right shoulder of the narrator with a sardonic smile.  Occasionally saccharine, with the voice of the Nobel laurate sotto voce "it's okay to indulge." A "writer of life" better than Saul Bellow, yet still makes one wonder what the Committee was thinking.","Joe Olipo"
"Annie Ernaux, who recently won the Nobel Prize for Literature, has prodigious powers of memory. The Years, considered her masterpiece, is an historical memoir of western womankind from 1940 to 2008. I say "of womankind" because the generalized experiences capture an entire generation rather than a single life. Nearly till the end of the book, the story is about all of us European or North American women who were born into traditional families during the Baby Boom (in Ernaux' case, pre-Boom). Every minute recollection is astonishingly familiar and yet dispassionate. The detached voice left me cold. I can see why some readers rave about her work, but I just can't get with it.","Chiara Coletti"
"loved it. Felt Mum present as Annie took me through the decades she lived, at the same age.","Kylie Moppert"
"A beautiful experiment in writing an individual life as part of a generation, a culture, a history. I found the movement of time here breathtaking.","Sadie"
"I loved the writing in this book. Best to read as an e-book so you can easily look up all the French references that you don't know. It enriches the text.","Jennifer Granick"
"I like the form and idea behind this much more than the execution.  This book is less than 300 pages but oh boy does it feel long. Ernaux essentially walks the reader through different events and memories from 1940-2008. There are no chapter breaks, though there are small section breaks. It kind of feels like a really long list of French history over 70 decades with some interspersed personal moments. Which does mimic the passing of time and how it can feel to remember time that has passed. Things can blend together, and one tends to remember the events and moments that really impacted their own lives. So I understand why it was set up this way, but it wasn't necessarily the most enjoyable to read.  Ernaux also breaks years up by describing photos of herself in the third person (the entire book uses the third person to describe herself or the collective "we"), and I think it would have been more impactful to actually see those photos rather than just read the descriptions of them.  My biggest critique of this, though, is that it reflects and describes some awful stereotypes and viewpoints that were in whatever cultural zeitgeist Ernaux was in the middle of, but Ernaux never critiqued these viewpoints. They're just reenacted on the paper, which was really hard to read. These moments include the colonization of Algeria by France and its subsequent freedom (and how Algerians 'did nothing with their freedom'), descriptions of Romani people, and stereotypes of Arabic people. It very much made me wonder if Ernaux doesn't necessarily disagree with the way these groups of people were treated and thought of.  And, obviously, this book is from the standpoint of a white woman who seems fairly comfortable, so it isn't the most inclusive in how it's looking at the world.  There are some beautiful, poignant moments in this, and even though I didn't enjoy the reading experience as a whole, I can see this being something I return to as I get older, as well.","Em H."
"I found this book so brilliantly written, so relatable that was almost painful in certain passages, especially if you read it in french like I did. I think this is the power of Ernaux's works, going beyond the generational gap and truly speaking to everyone's heart despite their age. This narration intertwined personal memories, collective memories and society's big achievement from the late 1940s to nowadays, through the use of old family photographs. The power of the author is to write an "impersonal biography", giving her opinion on social and life matters but always living room to the reader's interpretation. Simply divine, not an easy reading but it's totally worth it.","Onceuponaplace"
"This book caught my eye at a bookstore because I noticed the author had won the Nobel Prize and I hadn’t read any books by French female writers before. The concept of the book is quite unique indeed, and I’ve never read an autobiography that also tells the story of the author’s generation and the passing of time as collective community.  Since she only writes in impersonal pronouns, I found the book harder to relate to. I thought the most interesting parts of the books were when she described her own life rather than historical events. I think as an American, I didn’t have much context and couldn’t follow along with most of the French historical events she spoke about. Due to these reasons, I wouldn’t say the book was the most enjoyable read, but I will say it may me think in a new way.  I rarely think about the context of my life and experiences in a greater historical context, and it is an interesting exercise to think about what “snapshots” within my life I would write about in a memoir. I don’t think I fully understood why she chose each specific photograph she wrote about throughout her life, but I liked the theme of these photographs and the theme of the family dinners. The book didn’t have any chapters, so these recurring plot points helped give the narrative more structure.  I’m curious to read more about how French audiences relate to her work, since she is one of the most famous living French writers today. It was really cool how open and honest she was about her relationships, wanting to get a divorce, not remarrying and having many flings as an older woman. She certainly breaks the mold of a traditional older woman.  Overall, an interesting read but not sure if I would recommend to the average American reader.","Victoria"
"The Years is a beautiful book. Part memoir, Ernaux traces the contours of her life against the the social and political events of France. Using a unique narrative structure, she examines our own relationship with our past selves. I have never encountered an author who has so accurately captured the way people actually relate to memories and past experiences.  I am hesitant (and maybe unable) to describe the book much beyond this, except to say it was infinitely enjoyable, emotional, informative, and intimate.","Brian Mandel"

"The Years is a narrative period of Annie Ernaux's life from 1941 to 2006. Having never having read anything by the author before I was intrigued; however, the style of writing did take me a few pages to get into the style of writing but then I read the book in one sitting. Interesting and evocative of each chapter of the author's life; now I'd like to read more of her work.  Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for a copy of the novel in exchange for an honest review","Charlotte"
"A phenomenal memoir-novel that simultaneously explores the individual and the structural experience of the twentieth-century. Ernaux traces the shape of time, it's cycled and repetitions, it's transformations and how people live within and beyond what historians understand to be the "events" of a moment. Absolutely stunning.","Sarah Miles"
"This masterpiece melding personal experience with the flow of history essentially proves why Annie Ernaux is a Nobel Literature prize winner.","Ashley"
"We had such a nice discussion of this memoir in our book club. I kind of let the details wash over me and didn't worry about things that were too French for me to understand. I appreciated the events she chose to highlight and the ones she left out (for example, an American memoirist of her era would certainly have addressed the Civil Rights Movement while I had to do some light research on Algeria which is clearly more important in France). Once we moved into events in my lifetime, I was even more engaged.","Andrea"
"A fascinating book, a memoir told without the pronoun "I," The Years takes us through the life of a woman and that of her generation. It gives you the sense of what the year 1955 was like, and 68 and 2000. The author will look at a photograph, describe its details very unemotionally, "the girl" "she", which we come to recognize is the author, recognize the dark hair--oh, here it is light brown! She must have dyed it--as the village girl becomes a young lady, a camp counselor, a student in her women's dormitory, her teaching career, marriage--we don't have her decisions and all the emotion that goes with that, just snatches of memory, a scene... the life of her body gets the most attention, her feelings about sex, masturbation, longing, fear of pregnancy, abortion, young mother... the most dispassionate divorce. The "she" is completely embodied within the "we", how we lived, what we thought, what was happening in society and how "we" felt about it.  I particularly marveled at the blurring between the individual and her generation, not something I think much about--the attempt to pin a texture to our journey through the years. There's a most interesting thread as the young girl sits through family dinners, what the adults talked about--then she is a young mother, and the table is hers--then she is the older mother, the grandmother, listening to grown children's concerns. "We" move through politics, move through fashions, move through technologies and fears, moments of high involvement and moments of stasis, as politicians and concerns come and go, rise and fall.  This was such a vibrant depiction of the border between the individual and history-- what it was like to be a young person in the '50s, a young middle aged woman in the '80s, what were people thinking and feeling in '68 who weren't on the barricades, how were they viewing their own times? It threw me into thinking about my own Years, how I would formulate a generational "we" of my own local experience. How I would view myself and my times through the lens of a crumpled photograph. Ernaux's memory is phenomenal, and ultimately that is what the book is about, to preserve a life, all these fragments that make up a life, embedded in one's times--to put words to this before it fades.  We don't know she's married, there's no romantic meals or courting--just this: "Young couples with steady jobs opened bank accounts and took out Cofremca loans to acquire fridges with freezer compartments, dual-fuel ranges etc. The were surprised to discover that by the grace of marriage, they were poor in the face of all they lacked, the cost of which they never guessed, nor the necessity, which now went without saying. Overnight they became adults to whom parents could finally, without fear of rebuke, impart their knowledge of practicalities: saving money, caring for children, washing floors. How proud and peculiar one felt to be called "Madame" with a name not one's own...."      ","Janet"
"This is an amazing book of the herstory of my life...with a French focus. I had to look up lots of names. I was impressed with the author's reflections and remembrances. I was reminded of many things. The biggest change is the internet, phone/computers and maybe 9/11. ","Grace Butler"
"liked the 'collective autobiography' thing but felt a bit gimmicky by the end. there also wasn't much of an angle on the consumerism thing, just that she was a consumer and became more so by the 2000s; not really much of an exploration into it though, whether that was innate or encouraged or something. Flickers of incredibly interesting feminist exploration though, which was cool","Nick Saunders"
"Simplistic memoir-esque narration of French history, recording cultural changes throughout the years while tying everything neatly together with the authors own growth as a woman, mother, and professional. French cultural references might be hard to follow for non-French readers, but it doesn’t ruin the sense of familiarity conveyed.","Jens Bager"
"4 stars. This one has a different scope than her other works: most of it is an overview of France in the last half of the 20th century up until the early aught's, and how French society, then the world as technology made the world feel nearer, has changed in that time. Her attempt to be objective at times verges on the glib in the face of inhumanity. It is only towards the end when it becomes classic Ernaux, focusing on her development as a writer and how she used to think about herself and her profession in light of how the world was changing around her, does it become passionate and personable. It's in those passages the best moments of the book can be found. Not nearly as enthralling as La Femme Gelee or Une Femme, which I think as time goes on will be seen as her masterpieces, followed by Passion Simple.","Aurora"

"This is a very interesting memoir, written through the collective memory of all of French culture throughout the years between post WWII to 2008. If that sounds overwhelmingly comprehensive, it is and it isn’t. She covers lots of events that happened during those years, but the style is very superficial, almost like a bulleted list. Except that the list is written by a Nobel prize winner, so it’s literary and beautifully done. Layered over this running context is her own story about having children, having a career, getting divorced, growing older. There’s so little detail about her - it’s like a whisper of who she is. And layered over her personal story is a meta essay about how she is going to write this book. Did I love it? Not really, because I didn’t feel that invested in her as a character, and I’m hopelessly American and ignorant of much of the culture in France that she writes about. But some of the writing, particularly her observations about her children and about her own aging, left me breathless with their beauty and personal truth.","Connie"
"It took me a little while to get into this book but once I did, I really enjoyed it. Such an interesting and unique format - it’s been called a ‘collective autobiography’ and that’s a pretty apt description. It recounts the contemporary history of France through a series of fragments, memories, snapshots from Ernaux - with allusions to her own life made throughout through the collective ‘we’. It made me think about how different generations relate to the politics, culture, media spectacles of the day, how they have shaped us and continue to shape us. It was also a very readable and engaging reflection on French history - from the post-war years to 1968 to the Chirac presidency.","Nadia Inha"
"I am still processing this book but I loved it because she and I shared this time period in different places. She gave me the gift of words to describe my similar experiences.","Teresa Lloyd"
"Unlike any memoir I have ever read; a collective journey through the past several decades. I felt particularly attached to her description of the journey of women's rights and her description at the end on the passing of time. Worth the read.","Alyssa"
"Wow. A book, a story, a history, an autobiography that is both breathfilled and breathless in it’s telling. Even in its reading, it left me feeling full of life and breathless, aware of the transient and overlapping nature of time, which Ernaux expresses, seemingly impossibly, in words.  Benjamin and Proust clearly influence Ernaux’s thinking, yet the way in which she grounds their complex ideas of time in social, cultural, political, and personal events over a span of 60 years makes those ideas come alive in a new, magical way.  I found this book full of lessons in the craft of writing nonfiction as well. Ernaux is an inspiration.","Megumi"
"Fantastic book  Really liked the atmosphere in this book. Fascinating to follow Annie through all those years. Although she older than me, There is a lot that I can recognise, although living in another country. I really liked the paintings in words, that she created around the pictures. One thing I miss, is maybe that this book could be still better, if I had manage to read it in French. ","Lennart Petersson"

"Crazy what changes and events people born during World War II have witnessed throughout their lives. With modern medicine enabling people to live longer (a trend that also intensified during that time in Western countries), it’s only natural that a single average person is able to witness more societal progress throughout their lives. But the sheer waves of new technology and political movements from 1940 to 2010 are probably unlike anything else in the history of civilization.  It’s exciting to read such an eloquent recounting of all these developments from an intimate individual perspective like this. I wonder if this book is more exciting if you didn’t actually live through that time yourself. Because I clearly became less interested once the book arrived in the era for which I already had more hisitorical knowledge before reading.  Especially the parts that were more Franco-centric were interesting, in that regard, compared to the more big-picture events in the more recent „globalized world“ since I didn’t have that distinct of an idea of what life in France was like in the 1940s or 1950s.","Pascal"
"I read the English translation, which was excellent and did a wonderful job of staying true to the author’s voice while helping readers who might not be familiar with all of the French references. While the writing style takes a bit of getting used to, Annie is a brilliant writer who encapsulates key truths about life that resonated with so many readers(I read it for an international book club and the discussion was richly layered). I highly recommend this Nobel winner’s work!!","Anne Wood"
"DNF- which I can count on one hand the times I’ve DNF’d a book in the last 15-20 years.  This was an odd style of writing. It felt rambling and disorienting as it jumped from decade to decade. A lot of French pop culture references that if you don’t know the person, place, book, music, etc make it hard to decipher The meaning of entire paragraphs. ","Katiun Attarpour"
"Erneaux's book is a mixture of essay, history, memoir, bildungsroman, and feminist philosophy. Tracing her life from her childhood in a small village in post-war France through the various decades leading up to the 21st Century and her approaching 70. Erneaux writes most of it in a first person plural, creating a collective that goes through the significant life stages and cultural earthquakes that hit France over the course of the 20th Century. But Erneaux avoids assuming her experience is universal. That plural "We" shifts, but seems to be always aware that it only accounts for a certain group. The French, of course, is a broad circle, but French women in particular. Most of the time white, but sometimes including others when the "we" is the "we" of students or progressives.  The structure, as well, contributes to my high rating. I read this electronically, so I'm not sure how the concrete object resembles my view, but there are no obvious chapter breaks. There are divisions within the book, and Erneaux will indicate significant shifts by switching from a broad focus back to a close viewing of a historical photograph of the younger Erneaux. She speaks of herself in the third person, suggesting some objectivity about her growth. In the final quarter of the book, her intellectual growth includes the genesis of this book. She writes of the idea forming in her head some 20 years before she finally publishes the work.  Reading the novel was a mixture of personal recognition (I, too, remember some of the events and even shared some of the same emotional responses), but also ignorance with a litany of events in France of which I have zero knowledge. The minimal footnotes helped in some cases, but were often absent, as if I should obviously know what Erneaux was talking about. This didn't bother me much at all, however, because in truth, what was important to me was the attempt to capture a collective memory of a culture. While I didn't understand every reference, I'm sure there are parallel references to events in U.S. history that shaped me in similar ways. Here's a passage I copied that notes what Erneaux is attempting with the book:  By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen-perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write. ","Scott"
"Everything I could write to sum up this excellent little autobiography sounds ridiculous but I'll just say this book made me reflect on the frivolous memories of my own life that I hold so dear. The t-ball games, Trapper Keepers, grunge music, etc. We are the sum of our memories, and this autobiography tried to touch on all of those mundane details to give a sense of what it was like to live during the author's life. It's all very meta and very French. This was my first Annie Ernaux book and won't be my last.","Thad Driscoll"
"So good!! Erneux captures the generational experiences of her peers in postwar France. I’m sure this would’ve been far more intimate and familiar if I were French, but there’s something about this massive list of everyday objects, foods, clothes, songs, movies, and political events that still moved me","Ben"
"This is a bit of an acquired taste as at first reads like a random walk down the memory lane. Ernaux could be off putting for some as she writes in the royal we or refers herself in the third person, and repeats herself with somewhat familiar names and places again and again. Despite all that Lex Annees is also a tours de force as a collage of sixty years -of sex, politics, economics, social cultural changes over the years, -to a level that she disappears in the background.","Ali"
"Such an interesting approach to memoir, even if I'm not familiar with a lot of the French current history/politics/pop culture she discusses. But situating oneself in the news stream to examine a life feels so much like the way people think but don't always write, which was cool. You can tell it wasn't an American account because she barely ever mentions work.","Lisa"
"Intimate, confessional yet written in a depersonalized style- the writer observing the intimate life of the self on the social/historical backdrop of post-war France. She charts her own history from a provincial conservative town, to being middle class housewife, and then finally as a somewhat liberated Parisian writer who sifts through her own disjoined family and French media memories, regarding them in a modern light. A friend in our book club teased her middle class politics and sensibilities- she was born a half generation earlier than the student movement of 1968, which she viewed at the time through a somewhat jaundiced/envious suburban lens. Political, erotic, full of ennui- so very French, but readable and formally striking as a sort of dissociated social autobiography.","Bo"
"She won the Noble Prize and is regarded as France's greatest living writer, but this memory book, which I read in translation, was not really my thing -- although the memories of a post war, left wing French woman who delves into life and politics and gender is definitely interesting in places. She reminds us what it was like to be a poor girl in pre-Abortion, small town France, frightened about the events in Algeria and the pullout from Vietnam, and dominated by one pompous leader after another (DeGaulle, D'Estaing, etc.). But it is a different genre than I am used to -- it quite literally is "memories”….sometimes, as she points out, other people's memories. There is precious little personal introspection. Every few pages, the book collapses into seemingly random check lists -- movies she saw, teachers she had etc, politicians she observed, corporate leaders kidnapped, thoughts about the USA. It is all from a French left wing perspective -- she did not approve but was somewhat amazed at 9/11 because it showed the USA was not invincible, for instance. Why did she win a Noble prize? While she does not really tell a story, it does depict a time and place -- perhaps like Philip Roth did much more effectively in post war Newark. Perhaps it was simply France's turn.","Peter"
"Although I'm giving this 4 stars, it's not because I really liked it. It's because it is an excellent example of what it is - an interesting style and way of doing an autobiography that melds the subject with the rest of the women her age and life in France - but I didn't particularly enjoy it.","Patty Simpson"

"Instead of outlining the innumerable topics/movements/ideologies amply covered throughout this deceivingly short ‘encyclopedia’ of culture. I would heavily push this book just for the goal(s) it sets out to accomplish.  A brilliant approach by memoirist Annie Ernaux to apply the tools of her trade not exclusively to person or place, but rather the space they occupy together. Importantly always within the strict realm of the times or, well, The Years, in which they do.","Liam Kelly"

"This book feels like looking at the last paintings of an artist, all the knowledge, feelings, fears and beauty bundled into one last piece of art. So many stories that have gone and lived through this person written down in a selfless depiction. I felt happy, sad and almost a losing of hope at what is a life, dreams that have gone and passed, memories and goals you strived for that washed away through the years. The coming and going of people and life. This book is beautiful, serene and melancholic just as a life is lived.","Aaron Milliau"

"“To save some of the time in which we will never be again” What an amazing line, among many others, but this one resonates through the whole book.

"This was her 9th book that I was reading, and even though some of the material had been covered in previous books that I had read, this was by far the best of her books. Perhaps because she is revisiting much of her older materials and experiences with maturity in hindsight, and perhaps because I am a mother and now a grandmother, albeit more than a decade younger than her, her reflections in her 60s completely resonated with me that I had to pause, catch my breath, and wonder if she had been snooping inside my head. I am not even European, let alone French, but her historical and social contexts are within my knowledge of French history and social eras.","Letha"
"The book was nice and gave a great look at how France changed from WW2 to modern times.  Saying that the book does splinter into subplots and things that lead to no where. This makes it difficult to get attached to any storyline.  Still a good read though.","Chakshu Khanna"
"In her famous "collective autobiography", Ernaux describes the societal, cultural, political and technological changes/developments between 1940 and 2004 through her own experience and those of the people around ber. She managed to summarize and/or analyze these changes in a very poetic style. However, at times, it read a bit like an enumeration of historical events I've read a thousand times before. In the end - it's a very pleasant and quick read with striking observations of a world we know, we think we know or we (claim to) remember, but eventually it didn't blow me away.","Sheline"
"This book focuses on France from the 40s to 00s through the eyes of Annie Ernaux documenting her experience in post war France as a child to the political changes that occurred throughout the 60s and the rapid modernisation that isolates her both from her parents generation and that of her children.  I would not recommend listening to the audiobook of this - it definitely would have better impact reading it on a page (or screen!).  Whole heartedly recommend!","Sarah"
"While this wasn’t my favourite book ever, I think it objectively is a 5star book, especially from the perspective of a writer. The depth of memory, choice of structure, and sweeping prose are stunning. The last 10 or so pages especially contextualize and reveal Ernaux’s choices and process. A masterpiece.","Paula"

"The first question one wants to ask is is this a novel or a memoir? The closest kin (in book terms) is Karl Ove Knausgaard's My Struggle, but there are others where the re-explored and re-imagined life can be considered as both memoir and fiction. The author is generally after a 'truth' that might not exactly please family members as being 'what happened' as well as being absurd to claim that your version is the "real" one but Ernaux has side-stepped or gone further by attaching the life of the narrator/protagonist to the events going on concurrently during her life. She doesn't separate herself as a single individual exclusively, but as both -- herself and a person deeply influenced, indeed arguably created by the times she has lived in. It's a breathtaking concept and she succeeded in giving me a new way to regard my own life -- something only the great writers can do, shift a little something in your head. Not easy to read but I suggest that if you plan to, don't get hung up on the details of what was going on in France but associate them with your own experience at that time in your own context and at the appropriate age. A younger person would find this more challenging but they might find themselves examining their present obsessions and beliefs more skeptically! I read about half the book in French and English together then ran out of time and read only the English for the remainder. I plan to read the rest of her work. Extraordinary. *****","Lucy Cummin"
"Ernaux’ capacity to revive past times is totally impressive. Her work is much more than a recollection of facts and personal memories. It is an intense attempt at rendering her own state of mind through times, and by extension the one of the society she evolved in. And she does an amazing job at it. Facts are usually easy to recollect but often difficult to grasp without context. By rendering feelings and common unspoken sensations of the times, she helps the reader to make sense of it all. The book might be more relevant to French people, who can relate with the numerous cultural/societal landmarks she evokes. But it will give any reader a fascinating vertigo-like sensation when realising how many transformations our societies have gone through in the space of just a few decades.","Astrid Courtay"

"The book is a heavy read, feels more academic in nature than a typical memoir, and at times I wasn't sure whether I *loved* it. It has a self-awareness that I accepted, even if I didn't necessarily enjoy it, as part of the nature of the personal narrative. As one who hasn't studied French or French history, and a couple generations removed from the author's, I was struck by the universality of experiences across generations and nationalities. Some of the insights and sentences took my breath away, and it is a book I may read again and save or store some of the best. I am on the fence about the five stars, but the book sits alone in its genre and is masterfully done.","Melissa"
"Repetitive and detached. I don’t think I knew enough of French history to truly appreciate it. Reading the translators note before reading the translation might help some. Picked up towards the end with some great commentary.","Lilly Hetson"
"This is tremendous . AE deserves her Nobel prize. A cutting , incisive memoir built around a life in France interwoven with numerous historical events , many of which I was not familiar with . There's a strong sense of the consumerism that dominates the latter period covered by the memoir having swamped anything else of value . She does criticise without providing answers to complex issues such as immigration - but that I suppose is the writer's prerogative . Read it and enjoy","Rob Hamer"
"Ernaux is a genius and this is a breathtaking memoir. It is original in every way. The style enables her to interrogate her life rather than report it. There is a high-level “we” narrator whose vision is sociological and psychological. The subject is positioned within the larger context of culture. It is her story but also a story of the time, of a generation, and of a generational post-war shift in French consciousness. Within that shift are dramatic changes in the public and private lives of women.","Jane Cawthorne"

"i read this for a class, and i don't think i would've made it past the first 30 pages if not for the assignment looming over my head. it starts out very disorienting with a list of items seemingly unrelated to each other, but as i kept reading, i understood that the details in this book aren't about themselves but about creating the whole picture of the moments in time she narrates. the good parts are *really* good, but they're very spread out throughout the book. there are some really, really poignant statements about the passage of time and the transcendence of memory (made me want to combust immediately) hidden among lots of other words that just aren't very engaging. it definitely feels more like a collage than a story. too many proper nouns; not enough narrative. it only became an enjoyable read once i started ignoring half the references and just rolled with the vibes. i generally liked it. maybe i'll revisit it when i feel like contemplating time a bit more.  oh i also skimmed past the second half during the hour before my class so maybe i just missed the whole point.","kristine villarroel"
"Well not my cup of tea but I felt like finishing it to have a wider range in my reading. The concept is actually quite interesting to use for yourself and share with you family, but also quite boring if it is someone not so close. Your life history and thoughts with related news and developments like how it felt when you received your first fax much quicker than a letter. So OK but not very original i feel.","Bert"
"Very interesting! I had to read this twice to underline things I remember (Ernaux is 12 years older). She writes a memoir of the years and her life 1941-2006 in France. I love the way she starts by describing a picture of herself as a baby and a 1 year old. Beautiful writing. She remembers only a couple things (the wallpaper, the outside yard) and then as she gets older, friends, class differences, food they ate, what they did at catholic church. They were so serious. Later, older still, she describes books they used in college, what the elders talked about, political positions, manners, pasting Tour de France winners in a scrapbook. She moved to Paris for school: the clothes, the concerts, how it felt to be 22, married, a son, and on she goes. Toward the end, you read it for wisdom and what she learned about politics, relationships, and war. A short book, a decent book. Ultimately it is about how our memories play tricks on us. Nice to know it was picked for the Nobel Prize in Literature 2022.","Lydia"

The translator does a good job of capturing what I imagine this novel would sound like if a French native speaker narrated it in English. Although many of the pop cultural references were lost on me as an americaine, I still enjoyed what I've heard is Ernaux's best oeuvre. If you're looking for an excuse to get lost in francophone culture, then look no further.","Sarah"
"This book, by the recent Nobel Prize winner, is fascinating. It is a kind of memoir, but the word 'I' is rarely or never used, rather it is written in terms of 'we' and 'she'. This is consistent with the telling of the life in a style that is like that of a news reporter, describing what is happening much more than what is being felt. Indeed, the sense that is conveyed is that the life being described happened to the writer, rather than being lived by her. And what happens seems to be composed of societal and historical trends and happenings much more than interpersonal experiences. Unique and, for me, kind of unsettling.","Kathy"
"Annie Ernaux was a teacher all her working life but also a professor and an esteemed writer of many subjects written in the style of memoir-as-social-history and told by an enjoyable storyteller. I previously read a shorter story by Ernaux of an incident in her personal life that took place during the early 1960’s. She didn’t dwell on that life experience at all in this memoir although the ‘60’s did take up a good part of the nearly seven decades that she had lived, and recalled with the help of her journals, diaries and notes.  It was the author's personal quest and she had always planned to write a book of the life she lived and the times she went through. Born in France in 1940, she gathered experiences and insights that only grew until 2006 when she became the narrator of her story but never used the personal pronoun “I” in what she viewed as a sort of impersonal autobiography. “All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.” p228.  Because Ernaux was born and lived in France the names of French movies and television, politicians, musicians, places, authors, etc. are different from those that I was familiar with growing up. It was a bit frustrating to not know of these people or books or music or places and it slowed down my interest. America had its’ own social issues and problems every 4 years, electing its’ next leader, and yet her interpretations and concerns could be universal. I experienced the same types of influences which impacts most of us while growing older. The writer expertly captured the pace of social change, and demonstrated how values and ways of living alter over the years, in an unpredictable way. Different from our own parents and different from that of our children. So interesting.  I could hardly wait until after 9/11/2001 and the other events until she sums up her life and begins to establish what, she realized over the years, was most important. To tell the story from her generational perspective as a woman, student protester, wife, mother, devorcee, etc. was important. To keep the memories alive even after she is no longer there to tell the stories. Each of us could tell our own story but it would lack the talent and conviction to speak of things we had been aware of but couldn’t find the words to explain. “The Years” could be relating to millions of people of that generation subjected to their own influences across the globe.  As a writer, Ernaux has been recognized for her contributions to the world and became the recipient of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature. We are lucky to be living at a time when translations by remarkable professional translators of such gifted writers from all over the world are available. Alison L. Strayer wrote “A Translator’s Note” afterword which added to my gratitude to a story well told. I will be searching for more by Annie Ernaux. ","Patty"

"The Years is a memoir without the "I" as the storyteller. It is a woman's story through the lens of a "she", "one", and "they", as it conveys the passage of time inside and outside of her to embody the collective experience of the time. While this memoir is a social history of life in France from 1940 through 2006, it is the experiences, thoughts, feelings and emotions of "one" woman who takes us on her journey of life and makes us see her society as a whole. It is the collective responses to social and historical events that give this memoir the depth of its story. This style, while I found a little confusing at first, gives power to this memoir. At times, you see yourself as the "She" in the story, living through the same social and historical events, remembering your own reactions to the same situations and settings, living through the same ambitions, wants and desires; sometimes, seeing the absurdity of your struggles in a society, and indeed, the world, that has become somewhat superficial, driven by unknown players whose agendas may not be aligned with yours. You see yourself growing up in the same type of culture, from childhood to old age, questioning your political, social and ethical values, asking yourself, if it has all been worth it. You grow old, you are retired, you have lost your partner, you have grandchildren, and while the world keeps turning, you turn inward to make sense of your life, the people with whom you interacted, your society that shaped your growth, and the world at large. I found this memoir a rich account of historical and social events in France, and the larger world as one collective whole. Well done.","Marzi"
"Amazing","Emma"
"She tells about ‘the collective sensation’ in between years 1940 and 2007. Her world is very small from the beginning and narration is also slow. However, both pace and perspective grow/speed up somewhere after 1990. It’s a technic that serves to show not only her personal time and perception of it but the global as well. She tries to capture collective stream of consciousness, but in its depictions of pictures and events book also feels like an oral ‘herstory’.","Kristina"

"Ernaux writes about herself as the author in third person, explaining at the very end her intention for this book: "By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of history. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense aimed at putting a life into a story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and the imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes and ideas, beliefs and sensibilities.  Ernaux accomplishes that with five stars. I was mesmerized by the language of many passages and recognized many cultural experiences as we are 15 years apart in age--politics, commercials, modern conveniences and mores, but the droning on and on through this same lens grew tiresome. I skipped along and dropped into the narrative at many different stages in the book. It just became tedious for me.","Polly Hansen"

"Called “the collective autobiography”, ‘The Years’ by Annie Ernaux is a splendid blend of humanity moving through time along with intimate observations of the author in regards to her own life and experience. It is the antithesis of self-centric and reminds the reader of that which touches the lives of all people… or most… or cross-sections. It feels at once personal and private and yet, recognizably choral. I loved this style of storytelling. It was impactful.  It’s a quiet telling, with an underlying urgency. The consciousness and perception of “the people” shifting with the passage of time. It’s poetic and sharp.  Something I noted was the universal nature of it. From cycles of war, poverty and revolution to the prejudices and oppression that came back into mainstream society over and over again, to the realization that France, through time, is not that different than America… than the UK… all places built on euro-centric values and colonization of others. It made me detest those in power and feel for the people impacted by those “leaders” and felt a sense of empathy for those on either side of political and religious dividing lines— in that we are all victims of the eternal greed, hate and power hungry monsters. But at each of these cycles Ernaux acknowledges the importance of that pushing-back, so often led or carried forward, by the next generation.  It deals beautifully with a woman’s journey, as well, from childhood through college and marriage and becoming a mother then life post divorce. The nuances of inner rebellion and the shifting of passions.  Annie Ernaux is such a powerhouse! So glad I’ve decided to read her essentials this year!","jo"
"I’m clearly not the target reader for this book. There were so many cultural references that went way over my head. Both because of my age, and because I’m not from France.  The references to underage sexual activities didn’t seem to serve a purpose, even though there were a lot of them for such a short book. If I didn’t have the audiobook to help me speed things up, this might’ve been a DNF for me.","Maria"

"A biography of the years of the post-war, which we are still experiencing. From the failing of May 68, and what preceded it, to the world experiencing the long 9/11 effect one cannot speaks alone.

"This is an intoxicating read for anyone who has lived through a similar time and place which is 1946 - 2006 France. It is a collage of the author’s life, written like a diary but probably retrospective. My interest increased when she got to the year of my own birth because we always care more about what happened after our own arrival on the planet.  The Years stimulates memories of the reader’s own life and will evoke any of the reader's experiences of France or the French. The comparison between different generations peppers the narrative. One minute she’s remembering her parents and then she’s relating something her adult children said over dinner. Early childhood and teenage years seemed to go more slowly just like real-life. Overall, this book is a replaying a grainy video of her life.  Throughout the book, there are snippets of world events like having the radio on in the background in the 1940s and ’50s, then the television in the 1960s, 70s, and 80. It seems to speed up in the 90s when information is coming through the phone and the Internet. There are lots of references to famous French people and news events so this would be more enjoyable if you knew all of those. It is a journey into France’s past where you can’t help but compare it with your own country. A comparison between Catholic Ireland and Catholic France shows how Ireland took about twenty to thirty years longer than France to shake off the stranglehold the church had on society.  Not sure how successful this book would be if it moved past 2006 into the age of misinformation, false facts, and conspiracy theories. That’s another book for a younger person – possibly Patricia Lockwood.  ","Neil Kenealy"

"I loved reading this. I’m finding myself comforted in a time of extreme anxiety by reading books that help me situate myself in the world, in time, in the U.S., in capitalism. Things feel so bad to me at the moment, that reminders that things haven’t always been this way, that we’ve rapidly acclimated to new and shitty conceptions of normal, are helpful and calming to my nerves. There were many times, really the whole reading experience, that I was surprised this was written in 2008 and not 2022 — everything feels like it’s happening for the first time when we don’t study history. (I want to get better)  I’m glad I had read some Ernaux before I read this, and would recommend the same to other readers (though this certainly stands on its own). This isn’t autofiction, but autobiography + world history. I feel there needs to be some sort of distinction between Ernaux’s brand of autofiction (good) and the kind that’s saturating the market right now (absolutely nothing to say, but the authors decided they want to be authors). Someone articulate has probably already articulated this. What I mean to say is, Ernaux is worth reading for anyone.","tara"
"A book that is deeply rooted it its historical time and space, but also transcends both. It describes “an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.” Although lots of the references about French history and culture went completely over my head, I also related to the stories about growing up and the different phases of life, so vividly described. I can see why this has won so many awards. Deeply feminist, raw, and innovative writing. Hard to get into at first, but I found myself clapping at several points throughout. It’s a book that sticks with you, even if you don’t always love it.  “Other people’s memories gave us a place in the world.”","Giulia Zzz"

"A kind of scrapbook of memories that follows the life of the author and the society she lives in. She describes it as having a palimpsest sensation not a literal one, but in the sense we all have of our own history, new memories and interpretations overwriting old ones, the most poignant and traumatic shining up through the overwritten text. The impression is of one continuous mental flow of Ted Kooser’s woman in mid spin, “skating backward right out of that moment, smiling back at the woman she'd been just an instant before“","Christopher Junker"

"I loved this memoir: childhood curiosity, adolescent angst, youthful hope, technological change, relationships, global events, and geopolitical crises and how they simply pass by onto the next.  Every generation's modernity is modern until, eventually, it becomes dusty and faded as the celluloid memories of Ernaux.","Carlo Tedesco"
"This is just a wonderful book. The only caveat may be that I share generation and gender with the author, which means that her experiences, words and feelings were very relatable for me, even though I was reading the (excellent) translation. The nearly complete absence of the first person in this very personal memoir is an enormous part of its appeal. That we all live out our lives amid and among other humans (including their music, politics, biases, expressions, values, religion, etc.) may seem obvious, but Ernaux artfully makes her story ours by bringing all this into lyrical clarity. In doing so, she also gives us a new understanding of memory - not only how memory works in us individually, but how it works across generations.","Joan Maclin"
"It's a collage of snippets. There is a timeline, yes, but no story. If I racked my brain I could come up with the same flow of collectively recognizable images. The images Ernaux diplays should be the backdrop of a story. Here it is nothing else BUT backdrop. No characters. No story. Call it what you want. A new genre even. I don't care, it doesn't engage. It is a hair-pulling bore.","Gert Van Rooy"

"The Years is both an individual and generational memoir covering the years 1941-2006. Although it is based on Annie Ernaux’s personal experience, rather than writing in the first person,with its corresponding “I”, she chooses the plural pronoun “we.” In this way she more fully captures the historical and cultural experiences of her generation, particularly that of French women, and produces what in some ways represents a sociological text.  I was unfamiliar with several of the French historical and cultural figures she mentions as well as some of the films and music she refers to, but I did get a great sense of the times she lived through, and the challenges women faced (movingly recounted through Ernaux’s own individual experience), particularly regarding their sexual freedom and self-expression. The Years is an illuminating book which reveals both the life of an artist and her country. Ennaux was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature.","Bruddy"
"I was initially confused as to why there was a gap of 10 years between its original publication in French (so well received, a leading argument in favor of her winning the Nobel), but now I know.  Littered with references to French history and culture, I found myself lost at times, especially in the years between the history that is taught and the history that is lived (events must stew before being declared notable). But if I ignored my ignorance (treating it being too time-consuming for this season of my life), I could appreciate the scope of the work and its attempt to "capture the lived dimension of History" "by retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory" (222).  I've often pondered the response that is so often provided to those that lament the state of affairs; that generations have griped for, well, generations that the world has changed fundamentally, mostly for the worse, and that humanity has kept up its hustle nonetheless.  Yet as "The Years" go by in this book, I can't help but think that humanity's footsteps have reached a breakneck speed, that their pace has quickened such that the clobber of shoes meeting ground--dirt, cobblestone, asphalt--does not truncate itself anymore into audible manifestations of deliberate movement; it is instead a constant whir of progress. Progress in that the subject is always looking forward, but a spectator might observe occasional veers to either side, or loops returning to starting points. Am I optimistic? Do I see a future?","Andrew R."

Despite the personal, memoir-esque premise, I found the way in which the author related to time, humanity, history, and personal relationships to be not only innovative but full of immense heart and truth. The lyrical nature of the text, and the use of images throughout, is demonstrative of the ways in which art and life can intersect to form something bordering on divine.","Kaitlin"

"A brilliant memoir of a woman growing up in post WWII France -- and as much a memoir as a social history. The tone and structure are boldly creative and soothing, like watching an old home movie of black and white images drift across a screen. Her constant movement from first person singular, to first person plural, to third person is, for me, effective in placing the author's emotions under a microscope and -- at the same time -- positioning her life and experiences in the social and historical context of post war France.","Claire"
"A truly fascinating book that resembles nothing I've read before. Ernaux is a master of l’écriture plate, with her simple, unadorned prose that is still strong enough to carry heavy themes, emotional baggage, and stylistic ingenuity. I felt that the translation was stunning-- Alison Strayer somehow managed to communicate the nuance of nous and on into English as Ernaux carefully sidesteps the autobiography of je.  I was also struck by the unusual format of the book, which felt both completely natural and brand new. Ernaux's life is peeled back in layers, each examined and analyzed by a detached, present-day narrator. Time collapses inward as Ernaux searches for clarity and finds none. Interspersed with her photographs of the past (described clinically, critically), Ernaux assumes the mantle of collective historian. She inventories life in mid- to late-20th-century France, sensitive to its political and social stirrings, tracking the rise of consumer capitalism and the cancerous growth of anti-immigrant and racist sentiments. I spent a lot of the book thinking about 1) how infrequently women are permitted to become "the voice of a generation" and document collective history, and 2) if there is an equivalent writer charting the decades in America, and if so, what would such a record look like?  Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by The Years and with Ernaux's writing. I truly look forward to reading more of her work.","Liz"

Ernaux conveys the sense of the times in which she lives, and anyone who has lived through the same period (more or less) can relate to her descriptions. What keeps this from being a five-star book for me are all the allusions to French things and people that are not familiar to me. Once again, I am in awe of those who translate in such a way as to preserve the voice and language style of the original.","Harriet Bicksler"

"This was an interesting read and a very interesting way to structure a nonfiction biographical story that skips through the time periods around world war 2 (i am not completely sure if it starts when the author herself was born 1940 or a little early or later? but around there) until 2016 (?).  it gives little snippets of insight into the historical moments, daily life and typical moments of the country during the times, reading almost like flipping through a photoalbum and getting little thoughts and memories of the person that put the album together.  it reminded me a bit if „Ducks, Newburyport“ in the way it was written (even though i am pretty sure this book „the years“ was written before the one i just mentioned but i read the other one before reading this one …) in that it felt as if we as the readers are getting the wandering thoughts of a person on topics -or in this books case specific times in history- but never to deep and in-depth but simple remembering something, shortly thinking about it before letting the mind wander on to the next topics.   i personally found that not the best style for a nonfiction work. if i get information about historical moments be it big evens or typical daily lives of everyday work people i want a bit more details. i want to be able to understand and feel and picture what is happening.  and sure in a way with this book and time time periods it talks about that is possible since most of us either have parents or grandparents that are in a similar age as the author and if you are European it’s very likely that -if the survived the ww2- they shared at least a little about the time around and/or after or what it was like growing up during a time directly after a horrendous war that left many places in europe in shambles. also it is still pretty recent history and i would hope that most countries still teach the aftermaths of ww2.  what i mean with saying all that is that even without too many details a good of readers will understand most of what’s being said because in many cases it could connect with a personal story they have been told or something similar.  but is it really a good book and well written if it’s leans pretty heavily on the believe that the reader will have a basic understanding of those times in France and specifically Paris to fill in the missing pieces to make it all actually be meaningful?  clearly it is working since most other reviews i have seen so far from this book are highly rated and raving about how wonderful and even emotional this book and the reading experience was for them.  and i do understand how that could be that way…. but again maybe not necessarily because of how fantastic this book tells what it says but rather because the way it reminds readers of things?  and if that was the purpose? well done!  but again i do not read autobiographical nonfictions to get snippets and skips through time that feel rather impersonal to the authors life.   i think this is a clear case of what you want from this type of book and how you will enjoy the writing style and what you want to read into the book.   if you want a clear cut nonfiction that just tells you the what and how? not the book for you!  if you want a book that is different and a bit strange not your typical nonfiction? go for it!","Dawnie"
"I can see why this book is so highly rated. There’s a translator’s note at the end which I wish I had read first for the context it provides. This para from Alison Strayer sums up the struggle I had in reading this book: ‘I have added a few footnotes. I had to look up quite a number of names, and incidents, which would perhaps be clear to many French readers but not to every English reader’. It was that lack of context which kept the content at a distance from resonating with me. I could have done with a few more footnotes as I was reluctant to keep looking up references that I didn’t get to French tv shows, presenters, celebrities, phrases, etc. Did really enjoy the sense of time passing in a life that flows through the book: the changing topics discussed at the dinner table, the analysis of who the woman in the photos is now, etc.","Malcolm"

"This took me longer to read than I initially thought; it’s a tough read that made me feel uncomfortable, in essence it did what Ernaux set out to do.  The Years is told in vignettes from 1940 to 2006, it is an autobiography told by Ernaux but not about Ernaux… it is France’s autobiography told through memories and perceptions.  Ernaux uses the collective “we” but throws in some “they” and “she” which at times made it difficult for me to separate her from the French collective she was conveying. Primarily I found I had to keep reminding myself that certain atrocious statements / views were not those of Ernaux but those she saw the majority French public convey as she lived the events.  It’s a tricky narrative tackling difficult subjects; war, human rights, consumerism, racism / right-wing politics - I could go on; in 227 pages Ernaux serves it all.  I recommend taking your time with this one and digesting it fully once you’re done; allowing you to process the full effect of this rare narrative style.","Lili"
"The Years is a memoir by Annie Ernaux, covering the period from the end of WWII to the early 2000s in France. It flits between recollections of her past–framed by descriptions of personal photographs– and vignettes about moments in history and pop culture shared by her generation. The memoir encapsulates so much, but what resonanted with me most was her exploration of how we develop a conciousness about the state of the world and then grow to willfully stifle that consience, knowing full well that, as Ernaux puts it, "a 'secure profession' and money [doesn't] necessarily bring happiness."  And then (since Ernaux loves lists): -How do we feel the invisble threads of history sewing us together, while still being somehow wholly indifferent to it? -Why do we long for sweeping change and revolution while we willingly succumb to whatever society decides our lives must be? -How does motherhood change a woman, strip her of her individuality, her thoughts, her independence?  I never thought a memoir could be so thoughtful, philosophical, and transformative.","Mehak Sarang"

"I gave this 4 stars because I would not tell everyone I meet, “You need to read this!” Yet it is a memoir that is written in a very unique style and I can see why it won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature! Although she is French, and when she writes about the collective happenings, they are happening in France, there are SO many similarities to the US that it shocked me. And her collective commentary on childhood, on teenage years, on womanhood in its various stages all rang true. My book group read it and the discussion was very engaging.","Katie Nunes"
"It started in a strange way, it took time to get used to the numerous social and cultural references, which I did not get because I was not too familiar with France of the 40-50s but then it just became ingrained in my reading experience. It is a book about the reflection of society and its perks, the continuous circle of believing we are in a time and space that could be better while shaping our existence in what entails us at that exact time stamp. It was fabulous to read and feel the feelings of someone who lived through all these events, having a glimpse of the thoughts people had at the same time, something that is completely deleted in the historical Space.  It was beautifully written; the 3rd person allowed the author to expand her views and analyze what was going on from another person's perspective. You knew that the "She" was an "I" but that created a gloomy existence for the main character of an almost fictitious plot, which is often our reality through the eyes of the "other". I can see why she would receive the Nobel. ","Francisco De Andrade Fernandes"

"I can't recall how I stumbled onto this book (or became aware of Annie Ernaux), but I'm terribly grateful I did. This is a sweeping "saga" of a memoir, spanning the author's life from her birth in 1940 to 2006. She often writes in the third person, referring to herself most of they time and "she" and also often referring to "they" as well. I admit at times the book may have been a bit "over my head" given that I am not a French historian with limited knowledge of many events in France's recent past that she was writing about. It was definitely a learning experience for me, as hardly a page went by I wasn't Googling some place, or some event, or some person that she was discussing. I greatly enjoyed that aspect of the book. I also very much enjoyed her style, which is hard to describe, but certainly was not just straightforward prose. The breadth of topics she covered was monumental, everything from WWII to immigration in France, the cold war, technological advance, and throughout the book, the explosion of consumerism in post-war Europe. She writes in a bit of a sarcastic style that I found a bit charming, in part because it seemed rather French. Take for instance, this passage: "Sampling at the rate of one small container a day, an entire year would not have been enough to try every available flavor of yogurt or dairy dessert." Or, "The real test of technological courage was to use the computer. Those who were able enjoyed superior access to modernity and a new and different form of intelligence. It was a domineering object that required quick reflexes and exceptionally precise movements of the hands. In unfathomable English, it suggested 'options,' which had to be obeyed without a moment's delay. Pitiless and evil, it concealed in its inmost depths the letter we just composed." Throughout the book she uses photographs from her past as a way to begin the description of that period in her past. Towards the end of the book, when she begins talking about the process of writing the book itself, she describes her use of that technique: "So her book's form can only emerge from her complete immersion in the images from her memory in order to identify, with relative certainty, the years to which the images belong, gradually linking them to others; to try to hear the words people spoke, what they said about events and things, skim it off the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we are and what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope." There is also a wonderful description of the process of translating by Alison Strayer, the translator. One excerpt provides fascinating insight: "Early in the process, I vastly reduced the use of the continuous tense, and shortened many sentences...I don't think this 'unremitting continuous tense" has to be, or can be, literally applied to the entire book, but there are places where it could be considered the model for the writing (and for the translation)...There are sentences that go on for entire paragraphs...After reducing the length of some marathon sentences for clarity, I restored all that I could to their full 'breathless' length, with considerable help from commas and dashes. AE's 'breathless' marathon sentences sometimes gives the impression that time is speeding up. Time in the book slows down, speeds up, sweeps us away..." Indeed, this book did sweep me away. I read it over the course of a month+, picking it up to read a chapter or two in a very casual fashion , while at the same time reading another "primary" book. This is not my usual style. I am more of a "serial monogamist" when it comes to books, but reading it slowly over a manner of weeks really allowed me to relish the passage of time described by the translator, passage of time that did, indeed, sweep me away.","Chris Tilden"
"A tour de force in which the personal and the world-historical are masterfully interwoven. Ernaux has the eye of an ethnographer who sees through the mundane and into the substantive and the quill of a literary giant whose forensic incursions into the contingent reveal the universal. 'The Years' is a collection of fragments situated at the intersection between autobiography and historical sociology — it is supremely moving, exceptionally insightful and superbly written. The institution of the Nobel Prize in Literature has honoured itself by adding Ernaux to its list of laureates.","Teodor Grama"

""Family narrative and social narrative are one and the same. The voices around the table mapped out the territories of youth" (24).  "We were continually amazed by the amount of time we saved with instant powdered soup, Presto pressure cookers, and mayonnaise in tubes. Canned was preferred to fresh, peas from tins instead of garden-picked. It was considered more chic to serve pears in syrup than ripe from the tree. Food's 'digestibility,' vitamins, and 'calorie count' had started to matter. We marveled at inventions that erased centuries of gestures and effort. Soon would come a time, so it was said, when there'd be nothing left for us to do" (38).  "No doubt the information she receives about world events is transformed into sensations, feelings, and images with no trace of the ideologies that provoked them" (63).  "The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs" (85).  "Because summers had started to be all alike, and caring only for oneself was more and more of a drag, the self-realization imperative taking us nowhere fast, by dint of solitude and discussions in the same cafes; and because youth had come to feel like a vague and cheerless time whose end we could not see, and we'd noted the social superiority of couples over singles, we fell in love more purposefully and, aided by a moment's lack of attention to the Ogino calendar, found ourselves married and soon to be parents. The meeting of an egg and a sperm hastened the unfolding of individual histories" (87).  "Lively voices spoke with brutal frankness and cut each other off with no apology. Faces expressed anger, contempt, and pleasure. The freedom of attitudes and energy of bodies took one's breath away. If this was revolution, it started there, resplendent, in the expansion and release of bodies that settled themselves anywhere they wanted. When de Gaulle resurfaced--where had be been, we'd hoped he was gone for good--and spoke of chienlit with a grimace of disgust, without knowing the meaning we saw the aristocratic disdain for revolt, which he reduced to a word conveying both excrement and copulation, a bestial squirming, the instincts broke free" (98).  "Our parents and the middle-aged were from another time, not the least in their very insistence on trying to understand the young. We took in their opinions and advice as pure information. And we would not grow old" (111).  "Only facts presented on TV achieved the status of reality. Everyone had a color set. [...] It gave us a power of quotation that was constantly renewed by current events and news items. It provided information on medicine, history, geography, animals, etc. The bank of common knowledge which, unlike the kind one learned at school, didn't need to be accounted for anywhere but in conversation, as long as one began with *They said...* or *I saw on TV that ...* to indicate distance from the source or proof of veracity, as one chose.  Teachers alone accused television of keeping children from reading and of sterilizing their imaginations. The kids couldn't care less" (125).  "Identity, which had until then meant nothing but a card in one's wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express--a supreme and precious commodity" (145).  "With all the intermingling of concepts, it was increasingly difficult to find a phrase of one's own, the kind that, when silently repeated, helped one to live" (211).  "We could research the symptoms of throat cancer, recipes for moussaka, the age of Catherine Deneuve, the weather in Osaka, the growing of hydrangeas and cannabis [...] Talk to strangers, insult and chat them up, invent a self. They were disembodied, voiceless, devoid of odor or gesture; they didn't get under our skin. What mattered was what we could do with them, the law of exchange; pleasure. The great desire for power and impunity was fulfilled. We made our way around a world of objects without subjects. The internet engineered the dazzling transformation of the world into discourse" (212).","Kathleen"

"I considered *** but the book certainly deserves *****. Annie Ernaux has the wonderful ability to evoke memories of an entire society or decade in a few lines, just through simple pictures and no explanation. This strength was my problem - Not French and/or not old enough, I am not able to fully follow her without extensive research on the side.","Insa Handschuch"
"But these were not real memories. That was the name we gave them, but in fact they were something quite different: markers of an epoch.  A dense, rich work charting life in France from 1941 to 2006. It covers both the narrator's interior life and the changing political and cultural landscape over the decades. The lack of formal chapters and scrapbook-like structure creates a run-on effect reminiscent of the passing of time, making for an immersive reading experience. I really enjoyed the Proustian elements of memory, both collective and individual, and how we constantly shape and reframe one through the lens of the other. Some of my favourites parts were those focused on family rituals, where the participants change roles and ages but the overall scene remains largely unchanged over generations.","Laura Machmudova"
"Ernaux weaves personal memoir with commentary on France’s evolving social and political landscape over the decades from 1940 to 2007 and places it in a broader global context. Anyone well versed in French history will find this a fascinating journey. I personally had difficulty connecting to the material for the first 75 pages or so, laboriously sifting through French pop culture references that were meaningless to me. I’m terrible enough when it comes to pop culture I grew up with… For that reason it was helpful to read with an English translation as companion, as reassurance in those moments of self doubt. So happy I persevered. My comprehension frustrations diminished as I became swept up in Ernaux’ captivating language and astute observations such that I was able to integrate myself into her stories and history and feel a part of the “je collectif.”","Alana"

"So hard to write about this book. At times I felt I was reading a laundry list of historical events, popular culture names and movies, changes in Western culture with some "personal" thoughts and events interspersed. But then I'd be grabbed by sentiment. I'm close enough to the author's age range so, despite not being French, the things she would "list" struck a nerve and made memories similar to hers arise. I had this sense that she was trying to define if her existence really has had any meaning now and beyond the grave, which is a human issue! It is melancholic.","ingrid"

A woman of a certain age, I contemplate the death of my mother and my own life. I think about the research methods of visual ethnography.","Megan"

"Second Ernaux I have read. The Happening was really captivating and decided to pick up her ”magnum opus”.  In the beginning I had a bit of a hard time to get sucked knto the narrative, but once the book get to the sixties I had bought into it. A great narrative about the years, balances the individual and societal well and ends on a beautiful note. No complaints, brilliant book.","Juuso Rantanen"
"I can truly say I have never read a book like this one before. It is at once a memoir, a scrapbook, a collage of personal memories mixed with pop culture, political/societal climate analysis, and poetic imagery. Impressions of daily life, radio, television, advertisements, news headlines, beginning in France in the 1940s and spanning decades. I want one for every country, for every profession, every demographic, for every life I have not lived and will never know. Themes of feminism, sexual liberation, identity, materialism, are set in an intensely poetic and thoughtful narrative, though at times it could be a tad difficult to follow - references to lesser-known events in French history that required footnotes or a Wikipedia search. But more often, Ernaux wrote of universal human experiences - confusion, love, loss. It felt very Sylvia Plath. Overall, reading this novel made me feel so very very nostalgic for an entire life I have never lived. I think this is what reading is all about. This is why I do it. Five stars.","Fiona"
"Every page of The Years (2008) by Annie Ernaux was like a nutritious bouillon cube that kept dissolving in my thoughts for hours. I do not think I have ever read such condensed prose. It was filled to the brim with reflections, observations and images rooted in the memory of the author, who narrates not only her life, but also the experiences of her generation born during the Second World War. Humour mixes with poetry, politics with individual experience, literature with reality. I think most writers would need multitudes of 256 pages to tell a similar story. Annie Ernaux's succinct, lucid and precise writing style is her memoir's forte.  I wonder if there is a single page in this book on which I have not marked a passage that either made me laugh or marvel at Annie Ernaux's brilliance or simply moved me. Like other readers, I have the impression that if I were born around 1940, preferably in France, I would find even more in The Years. My enjoyment was hampered a bit by the need to check some historical details.  Compared to the memoirs I have read before, The Years is quite unique. Of course, the title made me think of Virginia Woolf's The Years though, which is also a poignant chronicle of fleeting moments. The detailed descriptions of family photos (how I wish the real photographs were included!) reminded me of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz .  Although The Years is undoubtfully autobiographical, the narrator avoids using the pronoun 'I', it is always 'she' or 'we'. I guess the author's intention here was to distance herself from her experiences, to look at herself from the outside and more objectively, and to emphasise that she is not just an individual but a part of her generation too.  I liked Annie Ernaux's luminous prose, full of the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone and kept trying to read The Years as slowly as possible to make the literary bliss last longer. It is not solely Annie Ernaux's merit but also the translator's. Alison L. Strayer did a marvellous job and her afterword is a cherry on top.    Rejection by Juan Carlos Valdeon Riaño.","Jola"

"At its best, has the sweeping grandeur of time paired with the brevity of life itself to really give the reader something they know is both deeply intimate and unmistakably a public monument.  That ran up until the 70s, at which point Ernaux, who doesn't seem to be one for rehashing what she has already written in other works, cruises a little. But equally, given she is framing this monument of prose with her personal experience as scaffolding to run up and down chiselling away, it makes sense it would drop a little in a period where by her own admission her inner life in all senses was at its nadir, or in its slumber.  The ouroboros is completed when Ernaux ends as she started, with a collection of memories she's chosen to save from time - or at least extend the memory of, the book will go out of print, will decay, will end up in a few national collections which in turn disappear - and with those last few memories collected, understanding the sentiment of this act, both noble and forlorn, I for a moment wept.","Nile"
"My first encounter with Annie Ernaux's writing & I can safely say that I will be reading everything of hers published in English that I can get my hands on. She is exactly the same age as my own mother & actually it made me realise just how much France (& England) have changed over that period & she made some very astute observations on personal, family & public life & how life progresses (or not) for good or bad. I read this shortly after Simone de Beauvoir's The Inseparables & the 2 could be linked in terms of looking back across the years especially with a woman's perspective on their lives & country that may be quite different from the male experience. Awesome.","Rebecc"

"It seems to her that education is more than just a way to escape poverty. It is a weapon of choice against stagnation in a kind of feminine condition that arouses her pity, the tendency to lose oneself in a man… She’s feels no desire to get married or have children. Mothering and the life of the mind seem incompatible.","Rebecca"

"In her autobiography, "The Years", Annie Ernaux leads the reader down the 60 year path of her life. She uses historical events as the back drop to her story, touching on the chaos of political life in France, grappling with changes in French society, as well as accepting the ever-undulating phases in her life and that of her family, with calm and serenity. There are no chapters, but rather cleverly spaced paragraphs that indicate the continuation of commentary, the ends of thoughts, and the beginning of new years. Ernaux rebounds between pronouns, using "she", "we", "one", to personalize and also collectively describe events in her close life, and in the life of her larger environment. My edition included comments by the translator that I would recommend reading in advance of diving into "The Years", as it will allow you to connect with Ernaux's intelligent techniques from the beginning. Also, there are many references to historical events in France, all of which some readers may not be aware; however her struggles with who she is and what she is becoming, are universal and heart-felt in their sincerity. "The Years" is a flowing journey of events, both personal and historical, beautifully articulated by Ernaux.","Rochelle"
"3.5 would be a better rating. Can't say I really enjoyed this but I did get the sense of time racing by. Found the reading a bit exhausting and had to keep plugging along as there wasn't a natural place to stop reading. Things (like life) just coming and merged into other things.","Deb"

"This is the best memoir I’ve ever read. The book is unique in that it is told through an impersonal, detached recollection of events, moments. and memories, narrated in the second person. She has an unmatched finger on the pulse of time and seamlessly weaves common themes about womanhood, time, development of self, politics, and modernity through fragments of things — moments, objects, events, people — that alone may have seemed unremarkable. She has a perspective on the world similar to Didion and writes with the same detached truthfulness.  This is so fun to reflect on books with this app!!!! So exciting","Emmeline Berridge"
"My own review of this book surprises me. In many ways I dragged my feet reading this. Ernaux’s prose (translated by Alison L. Strayer) felt like clockwork, slow and fast depending on how you tracked it. At time it was so rooted in French politics I felt I had no idea what was happening. And yet other times I felt so connected to Ernaux it felt like we shared the same mind since girlhood. Yet in the end I sped through the final 50 pages and was ready to start this novel all over again. It’s not a typical story and reminds me of a novel version of Boyhood. At times it’s just told through images, history, a collective “we.” At other times it explores the concept of memory, age, and the many different selves we all live and know one day. Somehow it captures the many phases we all feel, the points of originality, how we’ll never grow up, even if we know we will. I imagine if I read this book at 60 I’d have the same relationship to it I do now, just with the ever evolving context of outgrowing previous selves. We’re all the same this way, hence AE writing the book as a collective “we” and also a distant examination of “she,” AE, and the imperfection of memory.  “All the images will disappear…save something from the time where we will never be again.”","E.M. Welsh"
"This book is not just a work of remembrance in the usual sense with an objective of putting a life into a story to create an explanation of self. Annie goes within herself to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of the French society and the subjects she has seen. The book's last line summarises it's purpose well, to save something from the time where we will never be again.","Sharan"

"Coined by the ever-romantic, indulgent, and much needed for self-gratification (at least mine), Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows: anemoia is "the nostalgia for a time and place one has never known," and is one of my favourite feelings, for it's one I feel often and whose main driven force - time, past and present - always rivets me. This book is an answer to that beckon, that urge to be moved by pasts that I was never a part of in every way I didn't think exist and was possible. I never knew such an autobiography of both the world and the self was possible, and Annie Ernaux did it, and did it wondrously.  Reading this book I was trying to discern my feelings and deciding whether or not I liked them. It leaves me - as do often all the things I love most - melancholic, and strangely unmoored. The impersonality of its narration - which at times even felt too much like detachment - the collective "we," drive home in me and to me the insignificance of not just our individual lives, but also of all our history, our feats, our triumphs and failures as humanity, in the grand scheme - as much as I know this is mere pensive talking. How can the moments and connections in our life - each and every one of them filled with so many human emotions and complexity, that torment and elate us alike - be so utterly banal and cooly rational, once stripped bare of our thoughts and feelings?  Yet reversedly, it also leaves me in awe of the breadth and depth and multi-dimensionality of our existence - individual and collective - with all its wonders and tragedies, it fulfills my - and I believe our - quiet, impractical, unrealistic yearning to be perhaps not a part of, but immersed in and to fathom though only secondhandedly all the years that we never were. Even though there isn't a strand of DNA in me that is French - and solely for the purpose of thoroughly and fully enjoying this book, that's probably my only misgiving throughout this experience - I was still able to appreciate the weight of events native to France for every country and its people go through such fluctuation, and it isn't hard to draw up your own history alongside theirs - which I believe is part of what makes this book feel so universal.   All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieveing the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.","Rose"

"A modern, condensed and denser take on "In Search of Lost Time". I haven't read much that succeeded in creating a personally ethereal yet historically rich daze. The density throughout was a little too much at times, and I wasn't sure this was intentional until her explainer at the end, which helped bring it together for me.  I liked it alot, it briskly captures the grand sweeps and personal experiences of the author in the late 20th century. More often than not conveying the existential and almost claustrophobic nature of modern human life pretty well. A whole life in less than 250 pages.","James Johnson"

"Many people seem to be comparing with Maupassant's Une Vie, which she does indeed mention at one point as a possible model, but to me this rather gorgeous book comes across more as an early twenty-first century feminist retelling of Proust.  I know what you're going to say: Proust is two and a half thousand pages long, Les Années is just two hundred and fifty. I'm not denying that that's a valid objection. Though, just possibly, it might also tell us something about the differences between men and women. ____________________  Now that I knew what the book was about, I had to read it again. The last pages, when she finally manages to find her voice and become an author, are perhaps even more moving than the corresponding ones in Le Temps retrouvé. As is her take on recapturing the past: rather than Proust's miraculous and slightly implausible revelations, it is a prosaic and credible process of painful, incomplete stitching together, which somehow still manages to create something wonderful and ineffable.  This is an extraordinary novel.","Manny"

"Growing old is a strange and bewildering thing. I know very little about the French political and cultural era Ernaux dwells on, but reading this I was as quietly alienated by the arrival of our familiar present as she seemed to be. Her memories of a different world are somehow intoxicating.  The Years is full of lovely little observations - my copy is absolutely full of highlights. And the lack of any obvious structure (there's no chapters, no climaxes, no single event with any enormous thematic weight) gives it a surprisingly gentle sense of flow, as time rolls by and everything slowly evolves. We get the sense that Ernaux, like all of us, arrived in the middle of proceedings and was shaped by them without having any say in events, then left without her world completing any kind of neat narrative arc. There's an unaffected humility in it.  I imagine most readers under the age of 30 wonder how their own version of this might look.","Clare M"
"The German audio drama of Ernaux' books is a vibrant collage of images and memories, a collage less of her own life but of a whole society. In it, it is possible to see many of the big -isms in a time they too were small, capitalism, consumerism, feminism. It is a tender work, a collective wallowing, not without nostalgia and pride. Quite masterful!","Ben"

"I found the style quite captivating and eagerly read the translator's notes. In the French original, evidently she uses "on" the third person singular pronoun which can mean "we" or can refer to the general way things are done. The absence of the first person pronoun and the way she moves back and forth across the social history of her life--not from a researcher's point of view, but from her lives experience, what it seemed like to her, what it felt like, allows for a kind of intimacy that I found powerful.","Anna"
"This was an unexpected read. While Ernaux effectively captures significant events through time, and the experience of her life interwoven throughout, the book left me feeling like I was watching the movie of her life on a fast-moving, unedited, filmstrip. Certain portions are endearing — as she talks about first experiences with sexuality, coming of age and really coming into her womanhood — but overall I found the book hard to sink into. I’d recommend reading it in French if that is an option.","Nicole"

"-our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time  -mon histoire ce'st l'histoire d'un amour  There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it  Of all the ways in which self-knowledge may be fostered, perhaps one of the greatest is a person's ability to discern how they view the past, at every time of life and every age  At every moment in time, next to the things it seems natural to do and say, and next to the ones we're told to think-no less by books or ads in the Metro than by funny stories-are other things that society hushes up without knowing it is doing so. Thus it condemns to lonely suffering all the people who feel but name these things. Then the silence breaks, little by little, or suddenly one day, and words burst forth, recognized at last, while underneath other silences start to form.  She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live.  We needed to "re-source" ourselves. The "roots" imperative prevailed.  She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets with the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ("Solitude," etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between "I" and "she". There is something too permanent about "I," something shrunken and stifling, whereas "she" is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate:an image of light and shadow streaming over faces.  Between what is yet to come and what is, consciousness is empty for a moment.  She feels herself in several different moments of her that float on top of each other. Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been. It is a sensation she's had before, from time to time...She has given it a name, "the palimpsest sensation"...  ...she seems to melt into the an indistinct whole whose parts she manages to pull free, one at at a time, through an effort of critical consciousness: elements of herself, customs, gestures, words, etc. the tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once a mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. She has the same feeling, alone in the car on the highway, of being taken into the indefinable whole of the world of now, from the closest to the most remote of things.    ","Atri"
"My first experience reading Ernaux, who was a new writer to me when her Nobel Prize win was announced last year. I would emphatically recommend this, what is said to be her best work, as well-worth the read (I intend to read more of her work which has been translated into English) especially to anyone looking for a new take on a perennial theme of world literature: representations of memory and the past.  Like Proust, her main focus in this work is the recapturing and memorializing of fleeting moments of the past, but unlike her compatriot, Ernaux’s narrative is exaggeratedly (even stubbornly) discrete, rather than one continuous act of recollection. Several of the memory-sequences are seemingly written literally as snapshots of specific moments which in the writing become absorbed into a collective, national or perhaps even a “democratized” history, an aspect further underscored by Ernaux’s choice to write from the third person as well as with a collective “we”, rather than merely as a first-person “I”.  At times Ernaux assumes a slightly more omniscient, definitively historical stance, denoting the passage of time in the naming of cultural movements, fads and significant landmarks in French collective history, events experienced in one form or another by an entire generation of men and women. The result is a moving, nuanced, free-associative memoir of 20th century life that is both personal (i.e. subjective) and political (i.e. collective), one wherein a single life is refracted through a broader social context and thus shaped, in turn, by life itself.","Nick"
"Annie Ernaux‘s ‘Die Jahre’ is an incredible document of its and our time. Ernaux chronicles the life of a young woman (supposedly herself), structured by photographs of her growing from child, into teen, young woman, wife, (divorced) mother, grandmother, and everything in between. Through her life we get to live through a small portion of France’s history, spanning the post-war years up until and slightly beyond the turn of the 21st century. The text’s most striking quality lies in its ability to show the shifts in paradigms and the needed adaptability of the people living through these shifts. From political leadership, anti-war protests, women’s rights activism, to questions of motherhood, sexual freedom, and xenophobia, Ernaux talks us along through it all. While addressing huge topics from a small, individual standpoint, the narration never seems to claim an exhaustive picture of the times it describes. Beautifully, we see the world and it’s symptoms through the lens of the quotidian, the personal.","Nina"

"in writing this Ernaux says she wished to "save something of that time that never will be again", that time lying between the post-war years of the fourth French Republic, and the last few years of the 2000s ("which we never called the zeroes") with Sarkozy ascendant. in this she is miraculously successful, as she is in overlapping the collective story of a French left-wing generation, the story of a woman observing and moving in the Fifth Republic, and the story of Annie Ernaux.  Ernaux is simply a marvellous observer (does this come from her eye for detail, both heart-tapping and banal, or just the honesty to present them both without distinction?). in preference to the objectivist history-as-it-really-was is history like it felt. de Gaulle is at the same time unifier of the Republic as he is disappointingly old, ringarde to the generation that knows him only as a myth; and then quickly obsolescent — in some important sense, none of this progresses. it simply happens one day to the next, as lived days do, before the reflections and the impositions. and so the shock that Ernaux's « elle » feels in discovering she has aged is easily also the reader's, lulled into complacency by how little the passage of time feels like anything as it does pass.  there might be something to say about the repetition of list after list in the early pages, and the rhythm of some pages in the middle (the 1970s?) are perhaps a little sluggish. but there is a sluggishness to time natural, too; and it is a sense of having known such time that one has, reading Ernaux's final list, banal and glorious.","Justinian Guan"

"Inventive writing style that reflects the flow of time combined with vignettes of family dinners that punctuate the flow of memories with more detailed descriptions of relationships between people. The early part of the book has a lot of long dot-point lists and long paragraphs and sentences that are largely lists of objects and events, which become tedious. The latter part of the book is made more engaging by her insights and commentary. Very French; the footnotes are needed to understand some of the references.","Annette"
"4.5/5. This is the second book by Annie Ernaux that I’ve read and I must say that I love the way she writes and the things she writes about. I’m certainly gonna read other books by her.","Ann"
"The experience of reading this book is like letting a river flow over you. It is an epic tapestry of the history happening around mundane ordinary people who inhabit typical trends of their times. They grow up, they marry, they have children, they quarrel, they divorce, and we learn the experience of Everywoman through the flow of history and collective responses to extraordinary events such as the destruction of the World Trade Center. That old quester struggle to answer, “Where were you when…?” Makes the poignant point about how much it matters and it doesn’t. But the individual who can construct a narrative seems to matter very much as is always the case in Annie Ernaux’s work. I don’t know if this review spoils it for a reader, but this is not to everyone’s taste. But it is to mine.","Deborah Greenhut"
"Ernaux’s poetic remembrance of her life warps time in a way that makes you become highly aware of the light all around you, and each passing second. This made me think about the mysterious power of memory and its ability to transport us to both past and future - a power Ernaux evokes through words and shares with the reader.  Sometimes you get a chance to pause and reflect, but mostly there is the busyness of living. After a lifetime of yearning to write this book, Ernaux looks back and tries to capture something of her essence in the act of living. The search for herself through the years and in each experience is poignant and out of reach, so she ties her life to the story of the world. It made me more cognizant of my own existence in this specific time period, how my being is intimately impacted by this moment in history.  This is quite a fun way to travel through 20th century French history. All of this hit harder since I’m currently studying French history. It is striking that because so many events are simply referenced, I imagine a lot of the story that unfolds therefore depends heavily on the reader’s own association of events.  Annie Erneaux and Patti Smith share an ability to use language to capture something magical about memory, a magic that transforms the current moment. It feels like a precious gift.","Sarah Sinclair"
"Read it in French! If possible…","Ingrid Knipfer"
"I enjoyed this book, but did not find it as compelling as I expected, considering its big reputation (Nobel Prize). It is really a stream of consciousness reflection on the life of a French woman growing up in the wake of WWII, right on through to recent times. Having always been a keen reader of world and political news, many of the events and names are familiar, Dien Bien Phu, Algeria, DeGaulle, Giscard d”Etaing and so on. Ernaux also chronicles the changes in French life, including the rise of consumerism and the declining authority of the Catholic Church.  The recollections do have that musing quality of Sebald, which Ernaux has been compared to, and The Years does have a mix of memory and history recounted in a very personal manner. But the material in The Years comes in snippets rather than organized with cohesive chapters, as Sebald did with little chapters. Sebald also made great use of photographs that illustrated many of his recollections, while Ernaux often describes a photograph and what the memory means to her. I wish she had included the pictures. Perhaps this book would be better as an audio book, in which the memories could glide through the reader’s ears, but I found much of the book to feel similar, page after page of short, seemingly disconnected recollections. I enjoyed the ending very much, where the author did seem to me to impose a more complete form to her memories. ","Barksdale Penick"
"I'm not that fond of auto-fiction or memoir, and this book seemed to me like an endless spool of both. Our narrator is solipsistic in the extreme, but that does not keep her from making some insightful observations about consumerism and the march away from traditional family values, both of which come with our modern times. Still, to me the book was tiresome, with a plot that had no real beginning, middle or end, or even many events marked by human interaction. On and on with the observations of one human being, which, while interesting at times, was not sufficiently compelling to be worth remembering.  Oh, and I'm kind of stunned that it won the Nobel Prize for Literature . . .","Barbara Rhine"
"Reading a critically acclaimed book makes me feel like I have accomplished something. The Years is written by a woman that was born the same year as my mother, because of this I felt I was having a small view into my own mother's life. Annie Ernaux has written a memoir that reflects a lifetime of women and politics. She may be French but her thoughts pierce my heart as things we (my generation) take for granted that her generation helped us achieve. I am sure there are many older women, including myself that feel the pain of young generations losing so much. I digress. The Years is written in a style of bullet points yet covers so much ground with so much emotion. It is a book I will think about for years to come. It truly touched my soul","Judy Masters"

"In which she switches modes completely and writes a montage retrospective.  I was expecting to like this better…I would place Happening, A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, and I remain in Darkness ahead of it in my rankings…at least right now.  I was thinking that there’s a charitable and less charitable reading of this book…and then she did that thing near the end that she sometimes does where she talks about her writing project directly—and that threw a little bit of a wrench into my interpretation.  The charitable: She switches between points of view with fluidity—between she and we. She doesn’t do “I” here, as in other narratives. How to interpret this “we?” There’s a sense that the “she” is the historical she, her self at that unique time completely immersed in being (ready to hand?) and the “we” expresses when her reflective self, the continuous persistence of being self (the present at hand?) is being described in conjunction with that historical self, when they are united (maybe when she has journal entries to work from?). Ernaux knows that there’s a continuous passing out of being, a destruction of that unique self at that particular time that cannot ever be recaptured living doubled with the continuously aging constant self of the ever-present—and her stratagem is to record her life in writing so that she can go back and forensically reconstruct her former selves. She denies that there is any knowledge that is produced in this project—and she’s aware of its narcissism.  The less charitable: The “we” is just the collective an d she’s trying to speak for her generation. In this text, this POV is a bit problematic—and as “she” and “we” gets older they begin to sound avuncular (is there a female version of this word? avancular?)  Ernaux’s confrontation: Toward the end, Ernaux pretty much recognizes that both are happening—though she doesn’t really focus on my charitable reading. Instead she seems to want to claim that the representation of the collective can only happen through the particular.  Are there people that identify with her experience? Sure.  To my thinking, her argument is unsatisfactory.  This work is definitely best enjoyed last if you’re doing an Ernaux reading project. She even writes a little about her children and experiences as a mother—something that she doesn’t do in any of the other’s that I’ve read.  After reading 12 of her works, I’m tempted to say something intentionally provocative, such as Ernaux is mid, actually. But, though her project didn’t do that much for me, I appreciate what she’s done.

"I began this masterpiece by 2022 Nobel Prize winner, Annie Ernaux, as an audiobook but finished in hard copy, which is the best way to appreciate Ernaux's writing. She has created a memoir of a generation in France, with many of the events of the world such as 9/11 intertwined. Her choice to use "we" or "her" to talk about memories from childhood through old age gives the detailed events a detached quality, as if a sociologist were writing, even as she cuts in with deeply personal events such as abortion, divorce, children. Photographs (described, not shown)) become points that mark her aging process. The memoir also includes her struggle with how to write this very book: "So her book's form can only emerge from her complete immersion in the images from her memory in order to identify, with relative certainty, the specific signs of the times, the years to which the images belong, gradually linking them to others (p. 228)..."  The translator (Alison L. Strayer) has interesting commentary about the challenges of getting the "voice" right. She also mentions the intentional variety of spacing between sections: "There is method in it."","Lynne"

"I ended up enjoying this far more than I initially thought I would. At first I found this rather slow going, but, as I allowed myself to be immersed in the memories Ernaux was recounting, I was drawn into this rich memoir. Ernaux's thoughts and feelings struck a chord with me as she grew older and started referencing events I myself had lived through. I really enjoyed her use of descriptions of photographs throughout the book. These served to anchor the narrative in a concrete moment in time, while, at the same time, having the permanence of a photographic memory contrast beautifully with the fluidity of mental memory. This was a rich and rewarding read.","Andy Madajski"
"“Save something from the time where we will never be again.”  Interested to read other Ernaux. This piece was fascinating as a specific and universal memoir across the decades between WWII and the early 2000s. Being not French, a great many cultural references eluded me, but that she was speaking to the generational experience universalized the work beyond France. I found her tracing of sexuality fascinating, given the differing approaches between France and the US. A truly unique memoir/project.","Allison"
"Meh","Lee von Clöb"
"The Years is a kaleidoscope of events, time markers and personal memories of life, told over the course of Annie Ernaux's life, starting in the early 1940s up to the early 2000s. The conversations during meals and desserts, the assembly of family members, friends, lovers, husbands change as time progresses. Political and historical events leave at times an impression only to fade into memory and off the frame as new events occur and take over discourses in media and society. Photographs depict times gone by, memories of a life that was and in some respects continues and progresses to witness to new events, and lives taking shape in front of Ernaux's eyes. It was an absorbing read.","Mirko (Reading Literature)"
"Gorgeous but took me a really long time to get through. I 🩷 lists!","Alex Borden"
"Brilliant! Unlike any memoir I have ever read. Here Ernaux steps outside herself and assumes the roles of chronicler, sociologist, psychologist, feminist, photographer, political analyst, and more. I am astounded by the amount of detailed research that had to occur to create this volume. And then the task of assembling all that into one coherent whole … amazing. I’m going to read it again right now.","Joyce Heckman"
"Merging stream of consciousness with memoir. Some good writing, though felt cold and distant at times. Definitely set in time.","Aviva Goldstein"
"Ernaux is a magnificent writer. This is a kind of biography that I have never seen before, almost hallucinatory, tied to events and the world around her. I am not familiar with French history enough to know most of what she refers to, but the general outlines of the movements are so similar to American history that it was easy to map. Her journey from post WW II to about 2006 closely resembles the American Baby Boom generation with the Sexual Revolution, collapse of faith, and acceptance of consumerism as the highest good. I certainly do not think like her and find many of her beliefs repulsive, but this should be a great historical document in the far future when people want to understand what a life was like during the massive transitions of the past 80 years. The reality that all of us will soon be totally forgotten is melancholy and you can feel that ache in her writing. Well done.","Joel"

"〝she feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. but there is nothing.〞  ★★★.5  the years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future. pop culture and history is given voice here contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. a new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective.  this was my second ever ernaux after my fantastic start with a girl's story but this one sadly fell flat for me. since this one I've read two more of her works and it sadly continues to stand out as the one I couldn't connect with. while I think the concept of this memoir is truly unique and really interesting; mixing history, pop culture, local dialects and words of the times with what she was experiencing at those times is a great idea in theory; it felt a bit too impersonal and a bit too much like a french history lesson for my taste. it painted a really interesting background portrait and I've seen this done very successfully in other memoirs but it escaped the background a bit too much this time to keep my interest.  as a french person who knows the intricate historical details this would probably be really enjoyable in the same way I would probably enjoy a memoir in the same style if it was set in sweden but as it stands; I was missing a lot of context. the writing was as always really beautiful but unless you're french, know a lot about french history or like looking up references while reading; I wouldn't recommend this one.  cawpile: 6.43 ig: @winterrainreads","elin | winterrainreads"
"I understand that this book is a roman a clef: an autobiographical novel. The 82-year-old Ernaux has novelized the story of her life, and she has done it in an experimental form.  The novel is written chronologically but less in the form of a traditional narrative than in of a succession of moments or impressions. Ernaux alternates personal moments with historical moments as a way of making the book about her generation rather than just about her. She starts with her impoverished childhood in Normandy in the years immediately after World War Two, and her memories of her parents and grandparents talking about the recent World Wars, always using "we" and "us" as if the hardships of war had turned individuals into a collective. One of the striking things about the book is the contrast between these conversations and the conversations that take place around her own table many years later when she is a grandmother. Her children and grandchildren talk mostly in the first person singular, and mostly about their possessions or new things that they hope to possess. In this way, she powerfully shows us how France changed over the course of her lifetime.  Autobiographical novels are usually very introspective, especially with regard to formative, traumatic experiences. But Ernaux makes very little of her life's traumas. In this, she is the anti-Millennial. Millennials are famous for going on and on about their various traumas. Ernaux glosses over hers in a way that is astonishing. Early in the book, she briefly mentions an incident where it seemed that her father was going to murder her mother. This could not have been an isolated behavior, and the dynamic between her parents must have been traumatizing and formative. Yet we never hear another word about it. Nor do we hear much about her abortion or the reasons for her midlife divorce. I'm not sure why Ernaux took this approach. It probably had to do with her desire to make her story general rather than personal. I also think that she was referring to personal journals. I think back to some of the trauma that I left out of my own personal journals as a very young woman. In hindsight, I feel that I left it out because I was not prepared to deal with it. I was more interested in constructing a self for whom those experiences would not be important. I suspect this may have been part of Ernaux's motivation as well. She certainly came far from her origins.  Ernaux's decision about how to form her story interested me as a writer. But the impersonal approach disappointed me as a reader. I read novels to understand people, to enter the soul of another person, fictional or non-fictional. By withholding her emotions from her readers, Ernaux denied me that satisfaction. I'd love to read this same story told in a more traditional form, with more interiority.  Like my reviews? Check outmy blog  Author of The Saint's Mistress ","Kathryn Bashaar"

"Wow. This book is truly a magnum opus, and I’m still in awe at the ingenuity and creativity of the idea of a collective impersonal autobiography, at its masterful execution through careful word choice and breathless, winding sentences (also on the part of the translator, who successfully conveyed elements intrinsic to the French language like the pronoun ‘on’). Ernaux somehow managed to tell the story of her own life and of an entire generation at once, expertly zooming in and out and back again. One can only hope to mirror a project of this scale.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it could become a bit dull or monotonous to read at times, but that is a small price to pay for the brilliant reflection of the incessant passage of time without chapter breaks or clear transition points. I also think it would be less exciting or easy to understand for those unfamiliar with French history and culture.  This really is amazing. I adore books that address the phenomenons of memory and youth slipping away, and the “palimpsest self” finally put words to a sensation that I’ve increasingly felt over the past year. It was a sobering touch to include detailed descriptions of and introspection about photographs/videos of the author throughout the years. I also enjoyed the interspersed lists throughout.

"The Years by Annie Ernaux – it spans from Ernaux’s birth in 1940 to 2006. It is not a biography in a traditional sense as it is told as ‘we’ but Ernaux tells both her story and that of her generation. The book felt like a chronicle, record of facts, but I could feel Ernaux’s passion, somewhat disguised but yet coming through. I absolutely loved her references to writers, artists, politicians and I took note of many to learn more about them. Her language can feel raw at times and I like that too. That book is a keeper for me, I have it in Polish beautifully published by Czarne.  #annieernaux #annieernauxtheyears #annieernauxlata #books #book #bookstagram #ilovebooks #ilovereading #książki #czytambolubię #kochamksiążki #kochamczytać #ksiazka","Aga"
"Probably one of the most compelling books I’ve read year-to-date. It’s very existential…the main protagonist is our relationship with time, and how it protracts and shortens periods of life. You feel all of our petty reactivity to and complete intractableness of the current of time. There’s also something soothing about the authenticity of her account, she admits in the end its fallibility, but what seemed most appealing to me was the grace of watching it all unfold. This is a story where the characters are really trapped in the amber of the present, which is a really trite thing to say, but it worked for me. Maybe I’ll always be waiting to grow up—and the years will slip by with a quiet force.","mikhail"

"I found this a fascinating recounting of the experience of a young woman growing up in France in the years from the 60's to the oughts, but it was, despite being written from a particular point of view, somewhat bloodless, on account of the author's decision to leave out her particular personal experience and feelings and thoughts about that experience.","Naomi"
"I read this book while travelling around France and I - like so many others - have sufficiently become smitten with the writings of Annie Ernaux.  The Years (as the title insinuates) spans over decades, starting in the early 1940’s and ending in the late 2000’s connecting the realms of Ernaux’s rich inner life and the outside world with all that it entails; politics, revolution, immigration, technology, economy - the list goes on.  The book moves in a chronological order, starting at the birth of the author and moving through childhood, youth, parenthood and menopause. I found myself initially being drawn to Ernaux’s musings about girlhood and the madness of being a young woman - it felt eerily relatable as a woman in my early 20’s despite Ernaux’s girlhood ending about 60 years ago…  “‘I am a will and a desire.’ She does not say for what.”  As the book progressed into realms I have no way of relating to, it continued to capture my undivided attention. In thinking about why I was so enraptured by world events that happened long before my birth or the inner life of a woman going through early motherhood, divorce and the life that comes after, I realised that the book itself and what it does - not necessarily the specific story it tells - was the thing that fascinated me so much.  “What matters to her, on the contrary, is to seize this time that comprises her life on Earth at a given period, the time that has coursed through her, the world she has recorded merely by living.”  The documentation of life lived - in the way that Ernaux does it - is something so comforting and life affirming, that this book has automatically wedged itself into one of my favourites. It came to me at the perfect time, and I can’t wait to read it again and again and again. ","Marie."
"Very interesting book. Mix between fiction and non-fiction. Explores the impact on zeitgeist on the life of groups and individuals. You dive into growing up and maturing in post-war Europe. Some examples are harder to understand if you are not French.","Freek Van"
"“All the images will disappear.” Part memoir, part literature, this is one of Ernaux’s longer and more famous works. A series of photographs and videos are used as an outline for the author’s life. Visuals – I wish they had been included – were utilized by the author to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory.” However, it is not merely a personal reflection; the story interweaves essential world events, especially French events, with the author’s life stories. The story begins with a sepia baby photo in the war-torn Normandy village of Yvetot and ends with a photo taken of the sexagenarian author (“This is me = I see no additional signs of aging”), now residing in the quaint Parisian suburb of Cergy. We are transported on a fascinating life journey – both for Annie Ernaux and for society. The author attempts to reclaim and retain history, “the palimpsest sensation” (something reused but bearing traces of the original). Ernaux is an artful archivist, frequently using bullet points to punctuate events. And thus, the purpose of this book, “She is afraid that as she ages her memory will become cloudy and silent.” This fear may have been heightened by the loss of the author’s mother to Alzheimer’s disease. Yet it highlights the reality that we all face: “Everything will be erased in a second . . . we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.” The making of this book prolonged the ephemeral existence of Annie Ernaux – and, in some way, the reader.","Scott Cox"

"I read this book to understand a first hand perception of the events of may 1968 in France but I got so much more out of it. The book begins and ends with memories that are mundane and unimportant but have taken on importance for the protagonist. At the end the protagonist says the purpose of this book is ‘to save’ and then she goes on to list these memories and images that mean nothing to anyone other than herself. By putting them on paper they get to exist somewhere other than her mind. This reflects the way that we can become obsessed with certain experiences or memories that linger in our minds- not because they have any significance but because they are defined by our point of view. They are “the images of a moment bathed in a light that is theirs alone”. I relate to this book more than I thought I would because it is written by a woman born in 1940 and I’m a girl born in 2006, but it tells me that time doesn’t change everything, especially how its passing makes you feel.","Sara"

In my ignorance, I didn’t get many of the pre-80s cultural and historical (especially French) references, so the first half of the book was slow reading.","Adina"
"A great book and a monumental achievement that I did not like. It melds French political, social, and cultural history with personal history; it ruminates on consciousness, memory, and the ungraspable knowledge that one day, we cease to exist.

"Ms. Ernaux writes -- during the course of this memoir of her life and the wider context in which she lived it from 1941-2006 -- of her longstanding determination to write a personal history, her evolving concept of what she would like it to be, and how to achieve that project. For me, the end result is a mixed success. The earlier sections, which she surely wrote long after the events they depict, are really luminous and palpable, while the later sections are more routine and almost seem written from a sense of duty to finish. In the book's first pages, she reflects on how much is lost when an individual person dies, and how precious the smallest detail can become as the number of people with whom you share the memory diminishes. So, it should be no surprise that from a distance, it's easier to identify with clarity which personal and societal events and practices really were significant or exemplified a world that would later change and be lost. That perspective is missing, of course, from the years close to the book's publication, but she maintains a similar tone and technique for those sections, and it's not as effective. (I also have to admit that because she belongs to my mother's generation, I also had some 'ok, Boomer' reactions as a reader that may have colored my perceptions.) Still, I look forward to reading more of her work.","Jenni Link"
"4.5. A tremendous memoir that is as much about the author as it is on a period of 66 years in France and on Earth. Like most people, the author looks back and barely recognizes who she once was, so weaving through the personal and distant events that directly and indirectly crossed the path of the “she” she writes about is brilliant.","Mike Randall"

"Ernauxs writing changed my perspective on biographical story telling like none has before. I admire the way one can find themselves in her words. She’s offering a political and philosophical mirror for you, once you have one of her books in your hands.","David"
"One of my favorite reads of the year. Such a beautiful style that's so unique to Ernaux. I loved the mix between narrative, informative, and social critique. The style of starting form a photograph description to discussing societal issues and requestioning norms, but also simply describing the state of things, was gorgeous to discover.","Karim Rhayem"
"The back cover said it is one of the best books I will ever read… It was good but not the best. Probably because all the cultural references that I am not familiar with and all the French sayings/quotes that I did not understand.","Miina Lindberg"
"In Annie Ernaux’s The Years she writes of wanting the book to “capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory,” and I think it succeeds marvelously at that. What I found most interesting was the way she tracks the shift from a collective social identity to a singular, consumable identity in the decades between the end of World War II and the years after 9/11. But she also traces the way our sense of self (selves?) shift, or are replaced, as we age in a way that resonated with me.","Claire"
"As much as I liked this book, it would have been an even richer reading experience had I understood the copious references to French historical and cultural events Ernaux lists off throughout it. To have spent the time to research all of them would have been a long process. Despite my ignorance of the majority of the references, I enjoyed the scrapbook-like structure of remembrances of France from Ernaux's birth in 1940 into the 2000s, and the combination of personal history (though told with a bit if a distance -- no "I" or "me" to be seen) and broader cultural history.","Aly"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I had never heard of Annie Ernaux before she received the Nobel Prize last year. Then one day a reader friend of mine recommended this particular book of hers, The Years is a cumulative history of one individual and an entire country that spans from 1940 (the author's birth year) to 2006.  The story is told through a collage of "moments" drawn from various sources, including movie posters, political slogans, best-selling books, and significant events. There are two stories: one is told in the third-person's voice, which is disruptively the most intimate, and the other is told in the 'we' voice. It took me some time to understand this, but then quickly it becomes easier.   Even though I couldn't understand a lot of the references to French individuals and events, it didn't really matter. The fact that most historical events are similar made it clear how difficult life was in the past. We all learn about the challenges of our great-grandfathers.  She is critical of France- its involvement in the Holocaust, the long-lasting effects of the two World Wars, and its less-than-stellar past. All of these topics are written honestly, including the restriction on female sexual agency and its struggle with freedom, and liberation brought on by the pill, the quick transition to a consumerist economy, and the spirited use of technology which would herald the start of an endless spiral of unfulfilled yearning.  The Years, is a book for all time, and it talks about things from the past and the present. It's beyond its time and I will highly recommend this to all.  Please don't miss out on this, it's not an easy read but it's worth it.  Happy Reading!!","Megha Chakraborty"

"***READING CHALLENGE 2023 - JUNE - CLASSIC (LENGTHIER)***  What made this ambitious project work: the crafting of time in the narrative (sentence structures, different styles of writing - felt like having different narrators at times) in what would otherwise have been a flat piece of memoir - journey through time in an efficient, serene bullet train with some big and small stops. I liked the landmarks of old photos with descriptions.  Why I gave it a mid rating: no observation or sentiment I found especially compelling or moving.","Esther Hong"

So beautifully written, so elegantly built up of small vignets of actions and thoughts, giving the reader a deep look into a certain time in French society. A very French book - wish I had made the effort to read it in French- but lovely in English, nonetheless. Worth a read, worth a slow and thorough read.","Anne"

"The Years is a work of autobiography and history since the author talks about her life in the context of the world she has lived in, beginning with her child in World War II. For someone of Ernaux's generation, even someone from outside of France, The Years covers a lot of familiar territory and remembered events and examines how we process change.","Michael"

"Its a fascinating blend of personal and collective memory, a sequence of political and familial disappointments bargained over and negotiated against the author's endless questioning of what is asked of life. The central player is time, which almost guarantees no satisfactory answer to the multi-scalar question of desire. She sees shadows of herself in the younger generation she helped to raise; she sees shadows of herself in the older generation that raised her. And yet, she experiences a felt removal from both impressions, flighty as they may seem. It is difficult to ever truly know oneself. I'm not quite as old as the author at the time of her writing this, but the reflections suggest that time may not help so much with settling one's inventory of the soul. Of course, the opposite may be just as true. This isn't a sketch of the author as an individual so much as a particular timeline associated with a shared history. In her arrangement of events, its impossible to separate the individual from the nation. Very provocative, moving, consuming, affective... knowing that she'll lose her images, she takes part in this act of sharing. Met with her images, I feel that I've lost my words.","Hollis"

"Sutil and at the same time deep story about the passing of time. Written in a unique way, the pacing of the book makes us feel part of the passage of time, of the anguish and novelties of each decade. It leaves a lump in the throat and makes us wonder what is about to come.","Fernanda Heemstede"
"Got this when I was in Paris (brag) because Annie Ernaux is so hot rn and I can absolutely see why! It's kiiind of a memoir about a woman's life from WWII up to present day, but told from a 3rd person and Royal We perspective. It was like she was examining herself from the outside, but examining society and The Way We Lived from the inside. Different and interesting!","Eric"
"For book club, did not finish","Pat Dejong"
"This was my first attempt to Annie Ernaux’s body of work. In the back cover of this edition it states that Ernaux invented a new genre, the “collective autobiography”. “The Years” are exactly that, a chronological and continuous discourse of the author’s life, never told in the first person, but instead detached of the self and described through the experiences of abstracts groups, the parents, the teenagers, the students, etc. … Even when the author is referring to herself it is as if she is describing another woman. As much as I acknowledge the originality of all the above, this book did not quite “click” for me, and I felt mostly disengaged throughout. Can’t quite really pinpoint why, perhaps I did not feel connected to Ernaux’s life as a “character” or the fact that I am not the Francophile and innumerous cultural references may have been lost on me. I do not challenge at all that Ernaux is Nobel prize material, and I do recognize the innovation and the new form she created, but this book, for me, was not a hugely pleasurable experience.","Maria João"
"The Years - the English title of this book, was an incredible read. I feel this way primarily because of the skillful writing. No wonder Annie Ernaux was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Literature. I got this book from my husband as a Christmas present - every year he gives me a book by the current Nobel Prize winner. "The Years" did not disappoint. It is hard to explain the book other than it is about the lives of the author and her family. It took me some reading to understand her style. A lot of French words which I did not know but that did not interfere with my enjoyment.","Stephanie"

I had to keep from laughing at myself at how ridiculous and melodramatic I am being in my youth and I ended up texting my friends about how much I love them and how the great love of my life is found amongst my female friendships. I cant remember exactly where in the book I came to these conclusions, but I remember getting off the train and being so happy.","Viktoria"
"Structurally interesting approach to memoir. I had a lot of thoughts/questions about the tension between her choice to write in the first person plural and the inherent specificity of the narrative to her own personal experience.","Becky"
"Although Ernaux writes with wit and humor, which does provoke smiles and even laughter at times, I cannot say I enjoyed this book as much as I had hoped. I found it quite repetitive, and to be frank, outright annoying. Fragments of memories and diary entries combined with the unique way it is written leaves one with an empty feeling, that each paragraph feels either unfinished or far too long. I crave more depth and consistency in writing.","Evelina Taavola"

"This book reminded me of my days in France, the travels and misty winter mornings. This book seems a passage of time weaving personal recollections and collective memories to offer a profound exploration of French identity.  While the book initially appeared to me as a culture centric ( to french readers) but there are passages that stands for cross-cultural such as norms for women.  The Years is primarily focused on France because Ernaux crafts her memoir around a specific historical context, capturing the evolution of French society from the 1940s to 1986 and 2000s. By intertwining her own memories with broader cultural milestones—such as the Algerian War for independence, May 1968 protests, and the AIDS epidemic—Ernaux provides a panoramic view of French history and a clear sense of its influence on identity formation.  I liked how she narrated time through photographs from childhood to adulthood. Each photo contains a story and memory. But frankly speaking I would not recommend this strongly because focus was much on french. For me, it brought back memories.  A pov is presented through passages that it is a universal human desire to make sense of our pasts and construct our individual identities amidst societal changes. And it places a strong emphasis on the female experience, making it an essential read for women seeking validation and empowerment through their own recollections.  Ernaux captures the challenges, triumphs, and everyday experiences that shape a woman's life. And I think a few passages in book motivated me to read it. Ofcourse author is Nobel prize winner 🏆. So I wanted to read to know more.  Read it if you want to amass the understanding of another culture.","Manisha"
"This book is a beautifully written autobiography in which the author talks about her life from the point of view of an outside observer. It is mainly a book of social and political events and the author's observation of them rather than an autobiography of the author's inner most feelings. I felt as if the author deliberately played down her feelings to avoid the pain of their sharp realization. For instance Ernaux does not talk much of her husband, children or lovers or even give them names. I enjoyed reading about events and social commentary before and during World War II as that was before I was born and I hadn't realized the scarcity of things then. It was also interesting to read of the decades through I which lived from a French woman's view as opposed to an American's view. All in all, great writing.","Polly Rosenstein"
"The ebb and flow of this book walked me through the decades of the author's life - years that almost parallel my own.I easily imagined the photos the author may have been viewing - each triggered a story, a narrative that included a global influence and how it influenced her own experience. I am enamored of old photos, so I easily conjured up images described by the author. I read most of this compelling book in one sitting. I am left eager to read more of her writing. I dog-eared so many page to refer back to. I will be revisiting this book for some time. I do not think it will be embraced by all who pick it up, but it most certainly spoke to me. - Ginn","Virginia Pulver"
""Tell me a story about when you were a little boy". My daughter never grew tired of asking me when she was small. I don't think she ever really listened. But she had learnt that this was a cue to set me into a calm and pensive mood, the way we liked to be when we snuggled together.  The Years starts in this way, but continues beyond youth through the whole of life in a monologue.  It is not unpleasant, and we see the inner space of this left-leaning intellectual and teacher as she navigates a changing French society. The narrative is honest, often to the point of embarrassment, and I couldn't help wondering, am I, too, as easily manipulated as the narrator?","Frank"
"This memoir is written mostly in the first person plural, as if she is speaking for her generation. As such, it doesn't contain the personal, individual experiences that I prefer to read about in a memoir. If I had lived in France during the mid-to-late 20th century, I think I would have enjoyed reminiscing along with this book. But I didn't.","Hal"

"Annie Ernaux, a recent Noble Laureate and one of her generation's most acclaimed French writers, decided she wanted to put half a century into a novel. Bold, no? The Years, told in unusual second-person style that mixes the personal with the universal is a piercingly wise memoiristic depiction of 66 years of life in France. It's a Proustian act of revelation and creative memory--locating the emotional and cultural moments that loom large across decades and a poignant grappling with why those moments matter.  Ernaux has a preternatural ability to distill difficult concepts pertaining to the emotional rawness of major events--Paris student riots, the premiere of Breathless, 9/11--into the distinctly personal. It's an act of literary transfiguration I've not seen--the universal into the personal until it's once again universal. Her aphoristic stylings lend beauty to mundane moments as well as perspective into events so large we can barely even comprehend her scale. In some ways, it rearragnes how we think about the world.  I think the most powerful aspect of the novel is how it encourages you to think about your own life and your own relation to history. I found myself trawling back through childhood, first loves, early passions, and attempting to formulate what they meant to me and my relation to the world. How have the major events of my life--9/11, The Arab spring, 2016 election, rise of social media--impacted the world in which I live not only on the macro level, but the micro level? Have those tides of history shoved me into a different path or they only things to mention to the youths that I lived through when I'm old? I don't think there are any true answers, but I do think Ernaux's struggle to grapple with what it means to live when we lived and how we lived is one of the truly great questions that make this novel transcendent.","Jackson Brown"
"Difficult and depressing. I wish I had read it in French. If you think anything happy could possibly exist between 1941 and 2006, you will not find it in this book. It feels that the bleak announcements we hear in 2023 about climate change, about the various wars, unrest, murders, politics are just echoes of the droning in these pages. The reviews praise the depersonalization of style, but I wish there had been something about the author that allowed me to feel I was reading her memoir. That she refers to herself in the 3rd person heightens the sense that whatever is said doesn't matter, to her, or to any reader. The Chekhov quote at the beginning reminds us indeed, we are worthy of forgetting. Perhaps the José Ortega y Gasset quote lends to deeper probing. "All we have is our history, and it does not not belong to us."  more to be said.","Kitty"

Made me think about what I would put in a book about ‘our’ time and how we don’t have events anymore.

Also gave me some feminist gratitude re birth control and all those 2nd wave things.","Lollypop"
"How interesting. I knew the author had recently won the Nobel for Literature, yet there is no mention in this memoir of her career as a writer. That must have taken alot of editing.","Jmolentin"
"Obvious 5 stars. Literally I want to eat this prose for a meal. It is so condensed, every sentence contains a new, brilliant revelation that no one else could’ve ever thought of. The way that Ernaux can read groups of people and habits and situations and get to the root of how they interact w their context and what they mean on a sociological/personal level???? Genius! To see the world through her eyes! Constant 🤯🤯🤯. Also just baffled (in a great way) by how she incisively nails consumerism, identity politics, shame, etc… things that I thought were so decisively 2022 American but are not at all…  Definitely a slowww read though and one that people born in 2002 in Florida lack the educational context to fully understand (❤️😄😔) . But I kept up as I could, as I was just in love with this idea of a memoir snuggled into a recounting of culture/politics/events in France, which is both objective and subjective at the same time, one person’s experience with time intersecting with something greater, something collective—a History.  —  “Signs of collective change cannot be perceived in the specific features of lives, except, perhaps, in the disgust and fatigue that led thousands of individuals at once to think, in exasperation, “So that’s how it is—nothing will ever change.”  “And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”  “With all the intermingling of concepts, it was increasingly difficult to find a phrase of one’s own, the kind that, when silently repeated, helped one live.”  ","Haley Groth"

"I have to admit that I hadn’t heard of the most recent Nobel laureate for literature, so when I passed by a copy of this book a few months ago I decided to check it out. It’s ostensibly a memoir - albeit a fragmentary one - of the author’s life. From childhood to present day. Although it’s a much more lyrical read than that description would suggest. I can’t say it grabbed me in the way that - say - the work of Karl Ove Knausgaard has. However it is interesting in his sexuality, especially female sexuality, has changed since the Second World War. I might be tempted to read more from her, but I won’t be necessarily be rushing back.","Jeff Howells"

I loved the structure, the methodological spacing between paragraphs, the use of photos as an instrument of recollection & memory retrieval, her reflections about the book next to the regular narration, her way of explaining the cultural shift, the technological advances, the generational gap, the fragmentation of our identity, (the progress and downhill of) feminism and politics...I think the social and political commentary was brutally honest and reflects exactly our way of living.  We live like Debord predicted, indeed.  "Save something from the time where we will never be again."","Leda"

"i wept in an italian bar overlooking the mediterranean as i finished this book, which culminates as only it could: reflective and pure and intensely self-aware, ernaux is as we dream of being: lucid and unsparing toward herself (and at once sparing toward humanity-general) and deeply understanding of human nature. the translator's note is an ode to ernaux's impeccability and made me cry even further. i still feel like crying even now! that ernaux writes of the figures that define her and now so many of us will write of her in that way makes me intensely emotional  i underlined likely between 20-30% of the entire book, when i had a pen available. i am certain to return to this","Megan Burns"
"This was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.  A book where I had to stop at every sentence, re-read, sometimes aloud, sometimes in translation, share it with friends.  A book, which despite being about France and which often had references I didn't get, made me feel at home.  A book that I'm definitely going to read again at some point in the future.  In The Years, Annie Ernaux is telling her own life story in post-WWII France until the early 21st century interwoven with history. Through the passing years we see the change in the little girl growing into a woman and then ageing and we see all the changes France and the world goes through. We see the political and cultural references. We see the political and personal intertwined and inseparable. And things happening today start making more sense.  This is not an autobiography or a memoire. It's telling history in a personal way.  This is a must-read for leftists, for feminists and for those who are interested in the why and the how we got where we are today.","Byurakn"
"Beautifully written, just too many French references to look up to understand the context.","Erica Bedard"
"Reflective, fragmented, melancholy, Ernaux collages together six decades of a woman's life by jumping from photograph to photograph of frozen time. It's both a document of unfolding history and one individual's unfolding self within it. This state of reflection is one in which "past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other" like a palimpsest. As she puts it, her writing is an attempt to "capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory."","christine"
"It’s very hard for me to rate this book. I feel like I didn’t quite understand all its depths and messages. There were a lot of local and historical references unknown to me. Even so, the way the author writes the narrative, trying to stay objective, but letting her thoughts and emotions subtly and often not so subtly come through gives a life to what could’ve been a boring story about the past. Human insecurities, the everpresent changes and stuggles, the full circle(s) of life are shown in a very subtle but lively and common way.","Jasmina Begusic"
"Capturing life after World War II in France through one woman’s life. Big trends like consumerism, sexual liberation, AIDS, decolonization racial tensions and unemployment coalesce with pictures from the authors life Memory like sexual desire never endse  An erudite work, more essay and history piece than novel. I love Annie Ernaux her writing, but this book is an especially ambitious work that sets out to capture post-World War II France. The Years uses pictures as basis of recollections. From initial family observations and catch phrases that parents use: Limits: don’t ask for the moon or things that cost the earth, be happy with what you have to the desire to grow up as a kid: Nothing is certain except her desire to be grown up. Paris was beauty and power and the big city calls. The post war years are sparse initially, We lived in a scarcity of everything but people are optimistic about what lay ahead: Progress was the bright horizon of everyone’s existence  The narration is detached, and the novel uses a lot of sweeping statements to describe the day and age. At times Ernaux recognises that the perspective used in the book is not universal: The times are not the same for everyone. To be fair there are fun anachronisms captured as well, like arsenic cures against masturbation.  Big societal changes are captured, like youth asking more of their lives and the freedoms they want You ask too much of life and the rise of consumers and tourists: It was the dawning of the society of leisure Growing up as a female is hard (For girls shame lay in wait at every turn), and the way Ernaux writes time definitely seems to go ever faster but all the changes feel less and less impactful to one who has established her life through the rapid succession of decolonization, the advent of consumerism, sexual liberalism, women’s rights, May 1968, AIDS, racial tensions, unemployment. There is disappointment and reflection (As if her only progress in life is of the material kind) and the sense of the end nearing is evident near the end of the book: The infinite ceased to be imaginary  A sweeping book, following both a life and development of a nation, full of observations that one can only have after a life lived and fully experienced.","Henk"
"i enjoyed ernaux’s different approach to a memoir and memory more broadly however it was a bit slow at times for me.","Olivia"
"The Years to which the title of this book refer cover the period from 1941 to 2006. As to the events, people, and culture of France during that time, Annie Ernaux employs an approach akin to a collage, with snippets of references to news, books, music, films, advertising, street life, and other seemingly random gleanings, which, taken together, offer a picture that is at once broad in scope, minutely detailed in its particulars, and interspersed with astute and pithy commentary, the overall effect of which is beguiling and engaging in a way that traditional histories cannot match. A few examples for flavor:  "--the majesty of the elderly woman with Alzheimer's, who wore a flowered smock like all the residents of the old folks' home, but with a blue shawl over her shoulders, tirelessly pacing the corridors, haughty like the Duchess of Guermantes in the Bois de Boulogne, and who made you think of Celeste Albaret as she'd appeared one night on television with Bernard Pivot"  "--the dashing figure of the actor Philippe Lemaire, married to Juliette Greco"  "--the lavatories built above the river, in the courtyard behind the house in Lillebonne, the feces mixed with paper gently borne away by the water that laps around them"  "--the image of Scarlett O'Hara, who kills a Yankee soldier and drags him up the stairs, then runs through the streets of Atlanta in search of a doctor for Melanie, who is about to give birth"  "--of Molly Bloom, who lies next to her husband, remembering the first time a boy kissed her and she said yes yes yes"  "--the words of men in bed at night, Do with me what you will, I am your thing"  Within these excerpts and observations are the timely and timeless, the universal and personal, moments that are distinctly French, and others that reveal the porous borders crossed by cultural offerings from abroad. Collectively, they revealed to me a country I did not know while disabusing me of notions I had previously held that France was more liberal and open than the United States in relations between the sexes. In the latter instance, I noted much the same in the way of patriarchy, glass ceilings, inequality, religious repression, and denial of a woman's autonomy over her body.  Looked at solely as a document of historical witness, I would have given The Years five stars. However, although this work is supposedly a personal history as well, Ernaux eschews a first person point of view, so much so that one might believe that there is no "I" in autobiography. The collage approach is used here, too, but the effect is cool, distant, and sometimes almost clinical, to the point that the subject is neither an individual with whom the reader can feel great empathy nor an archetype that offers categorical analysis, and the narrative is neither as revealing nor revelatory as I might have expected.","Dirk"
"«She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. But there is nothing.»","Kristine Hegle"
"Much is said about its nature of collective autobiography, personal yet impersonal, as genre-bending, but don't the elders talk of "we", "in our times", while sharing an anecdote? If anything, it is the most fitting way to tell a story and Annie Ernaux does the same here.  It is less of her story and is more of a memoir of an entire generation. She gives the voice to a society, which is never an easy accountability to take hold of (and can one really speak for a generation, given the diversity in every walk of life?), and its role in ongoing events (which is little) and reflects on time and memory, giving food for thought.  But the book lacks the quality of immersiveness. A lot of cultural references, specific to the french, only adds to the distance between the book and its foreign reader. The prose had a sense of urgency, yet flows like a breeze, each sentence craftily built so as to pack as much as it can deliver. No complaints there.  Ernaux speaks of her ambition to view herself from the exterior but all she writes clearly comes from within; from thoughts. Even if she writes of the exterior, it's nothing but a popular opinion of the public at the time; say one can guess what Bommers think of computers. Presenting a simple idea complexly doesn't make it novel or game-changing.  Nonetheless, it invokes an urgent desire to journal down everything that's happening with you, around you, what it means to you and to the society as a collective (thus invariably inviting dissent). Maybe that's the whole point.","Jeshu Adhikam"

"Done reading #The_Years by #Annie_Ernaux: It is a memoir from the perspective of a working class woman from the 1940s of her childhood and the beginning of WWII UNTIL 2006 It offers a deep account of her life from her childhood in Normandy till her present day existence as an established writer in Paris . The scope is wide and traces all the changes in Europe and in France in particular throughout the decades from her own perspective as a working class female . She talks about the gradual collapse of the morality from the late 60s into the 70s and then the 80s and how that transferred into consumerism in the 90s Other themes of the book includes the gain of personal freedom and socioeconomic changes The statements are simple and serve the book well . It is structured as a series of snapshots each focusing on a particular year or period in her life and the events and experiences that shaped her as an individual and as a part of the French society so Each section starts by looking at a dated picture with description of that photograph talKing about the girl she sees in the photograph ( herself) in the third person . Sometimes she runs into WE into the first person plural in a gradual and subtle manner that does not confuse the reader .This first person plural reminds me of another book ( the Buddha in the attic). Throughout we are following the life of a girl that is Annie Ernaux who is trying to piece together her own past along with her social .political and the past of her country .Throughout she reflects on the social ,cultural and political changes that had taken place in France in the course of her lifetime from the aftermath of WWII TILL her present day and the way in which those changes have impacted her own identity and sense of self . We notice that throughout the book we follow Ernaux as she explains themes of class , gender and sexuality reflecting on her own experiences as a working class woman in a predominantly middle class society . She writes about the ways in which her identity has been shaped by her family background , her education and her relationships with men shedding light on some of the most significant political and social changes of the post war era including the rise of consumerism , the decline of traditional social structures and the emergence of new forms of identity and belongings . It is a powerful reflection on memory , identity and the passage of time .she draws from a wide range of sources including family photographs and personal diaries to historical archives and literary texts , books , songs ,radios , tv clips , advertising and news headlines to create a vivid and intimate portraits of her life and times. Her writing is marked by deep nostalgia and loss as she recalls and reflects on the people and places that have come and gone in her life. This is the Annie Ernaux as Annie Ernaux has imagined reconstructed and remembered . It is not her story alone but the intimate details of the French life that shaped society and brought changes It is sensitive and honest , so well written and it was a pleasure reading it …have learned so much in terms of historical events that shaped the world and French society ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ","Shahira alturkmani"

"nice book but i really don’t like white, eurocentric feminism. this memoir just screams “privilege” to me","Eylül Belden"
"While there's no denying how ambitious this project is, yet it leaves me utterly cold. It's so devoid of emotion and always keeps the reader at arm's length. To make matters worse, the social commentary is mild and trite. It's only been a couple of days since I've finished this, but not a single scene or piece of imagery has lingered in my mind. I still want to delve into Ernaux's oeurve, but this is a hard pass from me.","marcia"
"this was magical","rachit"
"wow","miki"
"actually reminded me a lot of leaves of grass in how ernaux embodies the experience of her generation and the adjacent generations through a record of her own memories. definitely has a stream of consciousness style that captures the passage of time well. feels very emotional, personal, and also informative. reminds me of a museum exhibit that just has stuff in it like furniture and appliances and dishware that people kept in their homes back in the day but that have their own story in history. it makes me wonder what aspects of or objects in my life will feel like history once i’m older and makes me wish i was the kind of person that had kept a diary my whole life or that kept up learning french so that i could try reading this untranslated lol","krispy"
"Last book in my French marathon and even if the majority of this book was pretty slow I still enjoyed being immersed in this everyday life of a nameless person and I’m glad I read this book.","Irma Lönnqvist"
"this was my very first introduction to Ernaux’s work, and from the very first page i was sold.  although this is a personal memoir, it is also general/social history in long form prose. it is a whole new mode of storytelling that feels like flipping through a scrapbook - very enjoyable form of writing. it is a stunning evocation of life in France, and there are so many memorable moments of absolute beauty and poignancy.","ashu"
"I believe this book would be even more interesting if I read it in French (unfortunately not there yet). Ernaux takes us with her through her memories of her 66 years, inserting her personal experience in the context of French culture of the time. There were many references I did not understand, but that Just Means a great learning opportunity for anyone who wants to achieve a deeper understanding of French society and culture through time. I think her description of consumerism culture is accurate, complete and very chilling.","Katja"

It actually made me feel like it will be a good thing to age!

"Best book I've read so far this year. It's not just a novel. It's a biography of a woman along with the biography of France from WWII to the 21st century. Well planned, well woven, well narrated. I've been thinking about it since I finished and put the book on my desk. I highly suggest it to everybody who loves literature.","evab2001"

"I want to read everything she’s ever written","Gen Braund"
"To me this book is deeply intertwined with Charlotte Gainsbourg’s The passengers of the night, as both creations are about nothing and everything. Annie captures how time rushes through us and leaves only a thin veil of memories in its wake. This book is not for us, the readers, but for Annie and the events she carries with her purely because she was alive. Beautiful!","Antonia"
"I usually try to finish one book before I move to the next as I enjoy submerging myself into the narration. But this book, I didn't finish; I just put it away for now. I will come back to it once I feel nostalgic of my childhood. And the childhood I re-lived through her writings.  P.S. From a historical lens, I learned a lot about France I wouldn't have looked for otherwise.","Vasiliki Makrygianni"

I put it on a list with Yi Yi (2000), One Hundred Years of Solitude, (Hypernormalisation),,,  The book’s ambition, to capture an essence of the life lived, of History, is daunting and yet she does it,, and I’m grateful she did  vague memory of Joachim Trier saying you can tell everyone’s story via the very particular","garry"

"This was excellent. A full lifetime of thoughts written in a stream of conscience style. It reminded me a lot of In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. Really beautiful novel.","Jack White"
"Did I like this? A resounding YES! How can I dislike anything that deals with the difficulties of memory. Did I love this? No. Did I feel like the Nobel was what made me pick this up? Yes. Am I beginning to lose faith in the Nobel after last year's slog through Olga Tokarczuk's The Books of Jacob? Slightly.  Interweaving politics, pop culture, likening the Pope kissing through ground in a time where religion is farcical to throwing panties during a Madonna concert, this was a fun romp through the decades between the 60s to the 2000s. But make no mistake: the aftermath of the wars, the political tensions, the anxieties of the future are very much palpable here, to the point where it becomes not a story of someone's life, but a story of our lives. So much of the world was covered, so much personal feelings explored. It is the perfect example of the slogan "the personal is the political" not just in terms of global happenings, but the reflections on personhood, sexuality, the body, motherhood, and the individual. Would I recommend this? Heartily. But don't expect too much, as I did. These literary prizes should be banned; they really tend to distract and sway a reader's reflections. But one cam argue that their existence makes it easy to discover new works, so just proceed with caution. I know I'm not done with Ernaux's works, so that should be a good sign. 3.5 stars rounded down.","Jaymee"
"Unlike any other memoir I've read. An unusual structure but one I found very compelling. Her writing is spare, beautiful and unflinching. I found it intellectually exciting to read. Recommended.","Sharon T"
"Annie Ernaux is just so good - also such a comprehensive picture of french culture and society throughout her lifetime. Never read a memoir like it and I loved it !","Niamh"
"Absolutely stunning. Quite simply one of my favorite works of contemporary literature","C"
"A E. writes about her writing of the book, this book: "By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History ... It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life."  It's extraordinary. I'm not quite the age she was when she wrote it, and I can't imagine remembering as she does--I kept wondering how she managed it. I only wish I was more familiar with French history; I'm sure that would've made it even more powerful.","Tracey Ormerod"
"Reread for French book club.","Ness"
"French ppl crazy","Zoe"
"This strange memoir begins with images, flashes of memory captured by Annie Ernaux's eyes and fixed in her mind. They are disparate: street tableau, scenes from movies and TV, performances, ads, sex, moments elliptical because they are instants. All these, Ernaux notes, will disappear with our last breath and flare of neurons; "we will be nothing but a first name," she writes, beginning a lifelong contemplation of time and the marks it leaves on individuals, societies, generations. Read more on my blog.","James Whitmore"
"5/5 stars. A masterpiece, in my humble eyes. This memoir is everything I look for in writing and more. I only highlighted a few sections of the text because all of the writing was enthralling and carried me through the eras of her life and the expansion of globalization with France at the center. Ernaux's voice is clear, trustworthy, and captivating, in such a way that you cannot help but keep your eyes on the page. "The Years" is a work about memory, a reflection on a lived life, and as a reader, I felt honored to be able to read Ernaux's story and reflect on the beauty of life. Some of my favorite sections:  "Save something from the time where we will never be again."  "Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation."  "When school started, we folded blue paper covers over the used books bequeathed to us by pupils a grade ahead. When we looked at their poorly erased names on the cover pages, and the words they’d underlined, we felt as if we had taken over for them, and they were cheering us on—they who had made it through, learned all those things in a year."  "In order to think, speak, write, work, exist in another way, we felt we had nothing to lose by trying everything. 1968 was the first year of the world."  "she asks, “Would I like to be there now?” She wants to say no, but she knows the question is meaningless, that no question related to things of the past has meaning."  "She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between “I” and “she.” There is something too permanent about “I,” something shrunken and stifling, whereas “she” is too exterior and remote. The image she has of her book in its nonexistent form, of the impression it should leave, is the one she retained from Gone with the Wind, read at the age of twelve, and later from Remembrance of Things Past, and more recently from Life and Fate: an image of light and shadow streaming over faces. But she hasn’t yet discovered how to do this. She awaits if not a revelation then a sign, a happenstance, as the madeleine dipped in tea was for Marcel Proust. "  "The new break in time was the fall of the Wall, no need to specify the date. It didn’t mark the end of History, just the end of the history that we could tell."  "the death at sixteen of the black-and-white cat of common species, who had returned after years of quaking fat to the frailty of the photo from the winter of 1992. She covered the cat with earth from the garden during the heat wave while the neighbors jumped screaming into their pool. With this gesture that she had never performed before she felt as if she were burying all the people in her life who had died, her parents, the last aunt on her mother’s side, the older man who’d been her first lover after the divorce, and had remained a friend and died of a heart attack two summers earlier—a burial that foreshadowed her own."  "These events, happy or sad, when she compares them to others that happened longer ago, do not at all seem to have modified her ways of thinking, tastes, or interests, which became settled when she was about fifty in a kind of inner solidification. The series of gaps that separate all the past versions of herself ends there. What has most changed in her is the perception of time and her own location within it. And so she realizes with amazement that back at the time when she was asked to do dictations from Colette at school, the author was still alive, and that her own grandmother, who was twelve when Victor Hugo died, must have had a day off school on account of the funeral (but by then she already worked in the fields, no doubt). And while the loss of her parents grows more and more distant in time (twenty and forty years ago now), and nothing in her way of living or thinking resembles theirs (indeed hers would “make them turn over in their graves”), she feels she is drawing closer to them. As the time ahead objectively decreases, the time behind her stretches farther and farther back, to long before birth, and ahead to a time after her death. She imagines people saying, perhaps in thirty or forty years, that she was alive for the Algerian War, just as they used to say of her great-grandparents “they were alive for the War of 1870.” She has lost her sense of the future, a kind of limitless background on which her actions and gestures were once projected, a waiting for all the good and unknown things that lived inside her as she walked up Boulevard de la Marne to the university in the fall, or finished the last page of The Mandarins, and, years later, jumped into the Austin Mini after class to fetch the children, and even later, after her divorce and the death of her mother, left for the United States for the first time with L’Amerique by Joe Dassin playing in her head, and up until three years ago, when she threw a coin into the Trevi Fountain and made a wish to return to Rome."","Erick"
"she has changed my life! after ferrante I wondered if I was going to find something of a similar caliber, and through a fateful recommendation I landed here. things appear at precise moments in our lives, or maybe we like to pretend they do, narrativize our years to make them make sense. I don't think I've ever read a book like this, the je collectif truly brings out a strong sentiment I couldn't quite place at the beginning. I loved the use of "we," of "they." I loved how I felt like I'd gone through the years with Annie, as well. Will try to read this in French eventually, now that I can. This settled Ernaux as one of my favorite writers, and on the first read!","‎"
"Never read a book like this before. Ernaux, a teacher from France, writes a memoir of her life from her birth in 1940 through 2007. She uses impersonal pronouns to tell her story (“je collectif.”) most often “we”, as if reporting the collective experience of her generation exclusively through her own experience.  (I’m reminded of what HST said about how the subjective can be closer to the truth than the objective).  Particularly interested to read about how we came to now, how the world has changed since 1940, and the unfolding of the globalized “modern world” in real time, and it’s personal consequences. Gets slow at times and the somewhat frequent discussion of French politics wasn’t particularly interesting to me, but recommend.  Started in a writing class at school in the spring, finished the last third on my phone during a slow day at the distillery.","Jack Kelley"
"A very different book for me. It was recommended by an employee in the Mill Valley CA bookstore when I was visiting there. I felt it would be a book my sister-in-law would enjoyed, so read it in her honor. I was in Mill Valley for her “celebration of life” event. Sad I can not hand it off to her and discuss it with her! I so enjoyed traveling through the years of remembering this French author wrote about and seeing similarities in my own life in the USA. This was an engaging read.","Sandy"

"“There was a need for war, as if people had suffered a lack of events for a long time, coveting the ones they could only experience as television viewers.

This is my first Annie Ernaux, and apparently she is the voice of french women and I 100% believe that. ‘The Years’ is unlike anything I’ve ever read - we are not following the life of one author, but the life of the collective female consciousness through 60 years of French history. Ernaux takes us on a roadtrip through the french obsession with sex - sexual desire, sexual liberation, depression because of/in spite of sexual liberation - labor movements, political upheavals, consumerism, communism, and seemingly most-importantly for everyone involved, the legalization of divorce.  She also pushes us to figure out what our generation’s unifying event is. For our great grandparents, at least in Europe and North America, it was WWII. For our grandparents, Vietnam. For our parents, 9/11. What’s ours? Or do we not get a unifying tragedy - are we just bleeding out, to steal a phrase from our generation’s greatest poet, Ms. Swift, from ”death by a thousand cuts?”  The translation by Alison Strayer from the original French is bril, but this is definitely a French book for French folks. Almost like if someone from Croatia tried to read through 60 successive years of Dave Barry’s “Year in Review.” 5 stars for execution, but 3 stars for my personal reading experience.

I loved the fact that through her memoir I saw all the french and international history from the 40s until the beginning of the 21st century. I couldn’t related though to many facts as they were related to the French history. It is a 3.5/5!","Spyros Batzios"

"Wonderful and amazing. It describes 60 years of history and of the writer’s life starting from just after the Second World War to nowadays (not clear if covid times are included). It mixes personal life and , to a slightly larger extent , France history, political and social.

"This is a memoir with no "I" in it. Instead, there is "one" and "we" which makes it a memoir of a generation, of the time in history from 1941 (the Liberation of France) and 2006, once the author has "retired" and looks back at her notes from over the years and decides to pay homage to her particular years on the planet. She includes everything from the advent of advertising and the subsequent thirst of consumers to have the latest thing to songs, books and movies that found their way into the lives and conversations of people at Sunday dinners. There's politics, of course, and the wars and confusion over which group represents what and which country is supported by whom. She also includes the relationships of the generations, the changes in parenting, the differences in expectations of the world from one generation to the next.  I've never read anything like it. Because her details were so comprehensive on so many levels, the truth she was living in France was also true in many ways in America. I found myself nodding at certain descriptions she gave of the 70's, 80's and 90's, especially those details about the relationships with children and parents and their changed ideas about consumerism and what one needs to feel happy and fulfilled. I'm so glad she took notes over the years and paid attention to the world so that a book like this could be possible, and also that she chose how to present all the information rather than having her journals published in 20 years and written about with a biographer's spin. It's an incredible book that will offer insights into this generation for ages to come.","Beachbumgarner"
"I loved her writing, but not so interested in the years she covers, as I lived through most of them. But her style of writing is excellent.","Elaine"
"Excellent experimental project, especially her use of point of view. I found the latter third to be rather sad, a reflection on how our lives become defined by consumerism and headline news instead of our own discoveries, but that is to her point, I guess: much of life as we get older is what happens to us, after we've done what we can to make our individual impressions. This work, I imagine, is Ernaux's way of coming to terms with her aging and of days past, which acts as a reclamation of self in its own right.","Eric Sutton"

"I liked « Les années » very much for a simple reason. It seems that through this book I have relived the entire existences of my parents and mine also. The author was born in 1940, 7 years after my own parents. This means that all the postwar stories she relates are similar to what I heard as a kid from my parents. The fact that she lived as an adult through mai 68, de Gaulle, 10 of May 1981,… make the book sounds like if my parents were speaking to me. Covering such a long time period, the book is a catalog of the societal changes and how they have changed us as individuals. One main theme is how time seems to be speeding up and how we are bombarded by more material “stuff”, and still it does not appear to have increased our satisfaction with life! 50 years ago, «…on avait le temps de désirer les choses, la trousse en plastique, les chaussures à semelles de crêpe, la montre en or. Leur possession ne décevait pas. On les offrait à l'admiration des autres. Elles recelaient un mystère et une magie qui ne s'épuisaient pas dans leur contemplation et leur manipulation. Les tournant et les retournant, on continuait d'attendre d'elles on ne savait quoi après les avoir eues.» Whereas now, in the 21st century, « …on passait au lecteur de DVD, à l'appareil photo numérique, au baladeur MP3, à l'ADSL, à l'écran plat, on n'arrêtait pas de passer. Ne plus passer, c'était accepter de vieillir. » In fact, it seems that this acceleration is even making us insensitive to the value of progress; “…le concept même de nouveau disparaîtrait peut-être, comme déjà presque celui de progrès, nous y étions condamnés.» And so, having relived the lives of my parents and my own life in a “fast forward” mode, added to my own personal search for meaning in this world, I share the author feeling of confusion about the sense of it all: “…ses parents dans la petite ville normande, sa mère ôtant sa blouse pour aller au salut le soir, son père remontant du jardin, sa bêche à l'épaule, un monde lent qui continue d'exister, plus irréel qu'un film, loin de celui dont elle fait partie, moderne, cultivé, qui avance, vers quoi, difficile de le dire. » Yes, we are moving forward, but it’s hard to say what’s our destination!

"I liked it a lot and didn't expect that since it's not your ordinary book with a plot and defined characters. But the avalanche of feelings, emotions, thoughts and portrayals of several generations of people all around the world (with a focus on France) is overwhelming sometimes. Nothing happens and everything happens at the same time. The development (or its history) of humanity since the end of the 2nd world war until contemporary times is presented chronologically and it makes sense.

It's like a cold, almost clinical anthropological analysis of a now dead era in French society, with glimpses of global history and also the way in which the author managed to cross it in order to become who she is at the moment. Although a valuable book given the vast amount of information it shares, due to the unusual writing style it is not a friendly read.

"Very unusual way of writing a book, that skipped through time in an authentic way. Ultimately, this book was able to move me.  The analysis of self and what self is, who it is and who you are at all times is jarring, but in a self-growth way. Ageing is non-linear, which is such an odd thing to say - and as a young(ish) person hearing how a 65+ person thinks of themselves vs. what others thinks of them is slightly scary.  The books is authentic and raw - more honest than I would currently be capable of.  For ambitious mothers / deep-thinking mothers, or father's supporting mothers this is an important book. Nothing comes for free.  Generally enjoyable, and has made me think - esp. about what growing up female means, and the hyper-sexualisation of women.","Alexander Kb"

" I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a book this short being called and epic but THIS IS an epic. Annie Ernaux has perfectly curated a vast array of material based on her life and the political climate around her life experiences into a concise and beautifully written book. There is so much of the author in this book that reading it feels like a highly personal and intimate experience.  I loved Ernaux’s use of descriptions of photographs featuring herself as a framing device that is revisited throughout the book. It consistently reset the pace of the book. A lot of the book is quite submerging due to its emotional and real foundations so you can become sucked into this world. The use of photo descriptions brings you back to an outsider position which is a grounding experience and I think essential to the book.","Harriet Ann"

"‘Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.’  All is mostly good, but I've still not warmed up to it (Ernaux's writing/work) stylistically. I'm reading Typewriters, Bombs, Jellyfish: Essays on the side, and it kind of reminds me of Ernaux's book. I think it's mainly because they discuss and explore similar events in their books. I prefer the way McCarthy's book is structured (and I just simply enjoy the content a little more as well; more variation/etc.). It's more organised, and I just like it more 'stylistically'. Maybe I'll have to read a couple more Ernaux(es?). A more thorough RTC later, maybe.  Also, thank you to S. for encouraging me to read this! I'm really glad I did.   ‘But we did want to remember the World Cup. It was said that people would have willingly relived the weeks of waiting around TV sets in the silent cities where pizza Mobylettes buzzed back and forth; the weeks that led match by match to that Sunday and that moment when, amidst the clamour and ecstasy we knew that, having won, we could all die happy, die together (except that it was the exact opposite of death), rediscover the great surrender to one sole desire, one image, one story. Those were dazzling days, whose derisory remains fluttered for months from the walls of the Métro: posters of Zidane for Eau d’Évian and Leader Price budget grocery.’  ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’","emily"
"Winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux writes a memoir and personal history of her life and France from 1940 to the present. It is not written in first person, instead the writer does everything in the 3rd person. Some sections are anchored by descriptions of photos of the author and her family.","Ann"

"Reads like poetry so read slowly and take it in. Beautiful book.","Karen Allen"
"What a gem of a book.  Ernaux has written an unconventional auto-biography, where she is the subject (written about in third person), but she shares the spotlight with her generational and cultural cohort, with many passages written about ‘we’.  “We had time to desire things, plastic pencil cases, crepe-doled shoes, gold watches. Their possession did not disappoint. We held them up to the admiration of others.”  I missed out on 2/3 of the French cultural references, not being of her generation, or French. But that didn’t matter - so many of her references are just human, very relatable.  “We laughed at the terror of the wealthy who hightailed it to Switzerland to stash their money, and condescendingly reassured the secretaries who were convinced their apartments would be seized for nationalized housing. The attack against John Paul II, shot by a Turk, came at a bad time. We’d forget all about it.”  A fascinating way to mark the generational and social changes since WWII, from the perspective of a now aged progressive Boomer. . In the last few pages she reflects on aging, the passage of time and generations in a way I’ve never read before. She’s not tender or brutal about it - just honest.","Tara Scheck"
"i guess i am late to the party. i recently felt overwhelmed, tired, struggling from this new ubiquitous reading, reviews, want to reads, numbers of books read flooding in. This book, this precious book, filled me with joy and gifted me a slow read. I would underline passages, sentences, I would send them around - what an observation, don’t you feel seen, discuss, think. I would enjoy the calming prose of sentences, the collage of analysis of images of talks at the table memorized, the consuming speed of structure, this unique ordinary individual life linked to the collectif of world and time.","Jana Katharina"
"A history of France from around 1940 to 2010, seen through the eyes of one person. A description of what it was like to live a seemingly ordinary life over the years, where everyday life is mixed with global events. Annie Ernaux writes a kind of autobiography from the perspective of a woman born in France in 1940. The woman is the main character, but the events are told in the first person plural: "We listened to...", "Our choice for president was...".  This is a fascinating novel that gives context to historical events and lets us know what it felt like to live through them. The pace of change in the last 70 years has been astonishing. Life today is different in so many ways: there's less hierarchy, the internet has democratised knowledge, religion doesn't dictate how you should live, women in particular are much freer to make their own life choices, the multitude of electrical appliances reduce the time spent on housework, life is faster, and so on. My grandmother used to marvel the same thing...  Of course, it is not all about external changes. Annie Ernaux grows older as the years go by and becomes part of the chain of generations. At the beginning, she was the child who was bored at the family dinner, while at the end she is the hostess who has learned to appreciate the tradition. For me, the most interesting years were somewhere in between, when the woman lived the free (and busy) 70s, or got a divorce in the individualistic 80s. Seeing how short human life is gives me a very poignant feeling. There are different stages in life and the years seem to fly by. From the outside, there seems to be a certain structure. However, based on the novel (and my personal life experience), the internal perspective is much more ... random. What sticks in the memory are seemingly random snippets from here and there: what a hotel room in Spain looked like, or what it felt like to commute home on the bus late at night.  I read a translation of the novel, but realizing that there are a number of very wise or beautifully written observations, I think I need to get the original in French. I enjoyed learning more about French culture and history and would recommend the book to anyone interested in France. ","Jose Sbuck"
"I read this book with my French reading club which is part of the Alliance Francaise. It was a really difficult read for me reading it in my second language. It was also made more difficult by its being devoid of any emotions, dialogue, personal details. While this book is supposed to be a memoire, it read like a memoire of French society since World War II rather than of the author.","Lisa"
"i enjoyed this so much (even with some of the french politics that went over my head) i loved the pronoun use and just how self aware it felt at every stage. i feel like i’ve never read a narrative that quite moves and acknowledges time like this. it also made me reflect on womanhood giving me new complex and individual (and collective) ways to think about it. wonderful","Matilda"
"Ernaux takes us through the years from the early 50s to the present time. She used France as a model, but much could be applicable to other parts of the Western world. It started with her childhood just after the war when outdoor toilets were common as well as shortages and a strict moral code in destroyed cities, villages, and countryside. Through examples of her life and commentary, she took us on the voyage towards consumerism, technological advances, free love, and the rise of the left and the right. Although I didn't warm to the book, it was a compelling read.","Sandra Bunting"
"Reading this book felt like sitting with a cup of coffee at Grandma's and hearing her reel off memories and musings of her past.  Whilst my lack of french history slightly detracted from enjoyment, same as when my Grandma goes off on one about politics, the book is chloc full of nuggets of knowledge.  Very introspective, and put into words feelings I've had rummaging around my head but could never put a finger on. I feel like I came out of this thoughtful read a wiser person.","Mark"
"  This book will probably be one of those that I will pick up again and again throughout the years. The sheer amount of passages that I highlighted speaks for itself (as you can see on the photo at the top of this post). From stylistically beautiful phrases, to clever observations or reflections on life as a woman that inspire to search for similar ones in one's own life. I think that depending on the age that you read this book at, different parts might speak to you more. I'd compare it to the phenomenon of the "Sex and the City" TV series, which you can watch an endless amount of times. Depending on the issues that you're going through in your life at that specific moment, you'd be noticing bits and pieces that you haven't paid attention to before, which I can see happening with this book as well.  My only issue with "The Years" was that it was too France-centric and it was impossible for me to fully get the meaning of all things referenced. Having started reading it in French, I quickly switched over to the English translation because I felt like I couldn't follow the storyline properly. It's only after diving into the translation that I realised that it was difficult to keep up with it in English as well. Cultural references like songs, singers, kids' rhymes, TV shows, movies, actors, as well as numerous historical events, both very big and very small, were mentioned, which I have never heard of before. I can see somebody French really enjoying this book more and it's the only reason why I personally decided to reduce one star from the final rating. Here an example of what many passages will read like:   the dashing figure of the actor Philippe Lemaire, married to Juliette Gréco [...] of Elizabeth Drummond, murdered with her parents on a road in Lurs in 1952 p. 13  It became shameful to hope for revolution, and we didn't dare admit that we were saddened by Ulrike Meinhof's suicide in prison. Through some obscure reasoning, Althusser's crime of choking his wife to death in bed one Sunday morning was blamed as much on the Marxism he embodied as on any kind of mental problem. p. 122   If you were to look up the details of each of those descriptions (which I was trying to do in the beginning), you would get a really detailed understanding of the French society and their collective memory. I couldn't stick to it throughout the whole book though, as it kept interrupting the reading flow. Nevertheless, imagining the author putting together the sheer amount and the details of these events, selecting the most significant ones for each year or each decade, was definitely impressive. The choice of the footnotes was therefore quite interesting, how some things were explained and others weren't. In my case I would have needed about four times more footnotes than the amount that was provided. Another specificity that I noticed since I compared the French original and the English translation throughout the first 30 pages, was how I ended up highlighting different passages in each language. I found some phrases more beautiful in French, whereas others spoke to me more in English. I'd therefore surely try reading the book completely in its original version at some point.   notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux du temps p. 17 (French original)  Sitôt rentrés à la maison, on retrouvait sans y penser la langue originelle, qui n'obligeait pas à réfléchir aux mots, seulement aux choses à dire ou à ne pas dire, celle qui tenait au corps, liée aux paires de claques, à l'odeur d'eau de Javel des blouses, des pommes cuites tout l'hiver, aux bruits de pisse dans le seau et aux ronflements des parents. p. 35 (French original)   The style the book was written in was definitely something that you would enjoy while reading. I even felt like reading some passages out loud because the rhythm of the words flowed so beautifully! The content was just as fascinating. Seeing the transition of society from the 1940s until 2006 through the shape of a collective memory, as well as influenced by the author's personal stories told in the third person, was definitely something that I haven't read in such a form before. From a society where hardly anyone traveled, hardly threw anything away, up until the current day times in the era of disposability, mobile phones, computers and all types of modern technology. It was really eye-opening, having the speed of how everything in our lives changed in a span of just about 70 years demonstrated in writing.   How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty ('Solitude', etc.)? Her main concern is the choice between 'I' and 'she'. There is something too permanent about 'I', something shrunken and stifling, whereas 'she' is too exterior and remote. p. 167-168  Nothing was thrown away. The contents of chamber pots were used for garden fertilizer, the dung of passing horses collected for potted plants. Newspaper was used for wrapping vegetables, drying shoes, wiping one's bottom in the lavatory. p. 37  With digital technology, we drained reality dry. p. 208   As much as there were parts that were very specific to the French society, there were just as many passages that universally applied. What it means to transition from being a girl, to a teenager, to a woman, the problems you face on the way, the reflections you might have and the transformations that you would go through as a person. All these found expression in "The Years" as well. The general idea of the book reminded me of Deborah Levy's autobiography trilogy, consisting of three books: "Things I Don't Want to Know" , "The Cost of Living" and "Real Estate" . Both women speak about what it means to be a writer, the discovery of one's own identity in solitude, going through divorce and life after it, as well as having children and seeing them grow up.   Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea has come to her to write 'a kind of woman's destiny', set between 1940 and 1985. It would be [...] a 'total novel' that would end with her dispossession of people and things: parents and husband, children who leave home, furniture that is sold. p. 148  When she can't sleep at night, she tries to remember the details of all the rooms where she has slept: the one she shared with her parents until the age of thirteen, the ones at the university residence and the Annecy apartment facing the cemetery. p. 166   I was extremely glad to have discovered the book and the author for the first time thanks to the "Barcelona Women's Book Club" . I felt like it would be an especially impactful read for women but even taken generally, it was an exceptional piece of writing. I would highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to reading further books by Annie Ernaux.   More reviews on my blog - KHVBooks.com","Veronika"

"To exist is to drink oneself without thirst.  Reading The Years is like watching one of those short videos, showing the evolution of dance or fashion throughout history.  Our memory is outside us, in a rainy breath of time.  We read the book, as if we are looking at photos and scenes, captured successively in different stages of Annie’s life; as if we are reading news reports about social, economic and political events; events which made an impression on her external and internal self.  Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.  The Years is freeze-frames of Annie’s memories and her existence; a memoir of one and all.  She begins a novel in which images past and present, her dreams at night and visions of the future, alternate with an “I” who is her double, detached from herself.  There are no chapters, but at the beginning of each decade, she offers and describes a photograph of herself, as a little baby, a child, a teenager, etc. Of course as she always does, she talks about herself in third person.  There is no “I” in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only “one” and “we,” as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before.  This is a writing project of a woman who has lived between 1940 and today, convinced that she has no “personality”.  She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen.  She wants to save everything that has been part of her life; she wants to save her “circumstance”.  The distance that separates past from present can be measured perhaps by the light that spills across the ground between shadows, slips over faces, outlines the folds of a dress- by the twilight clarity of a black-and-white photo, no matter what time it is taken.  She wants to hunt down the sensations inside of her; sensations like the ones that make her write.  Everything will be erased in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.","Helga"
"I enjoyed this and look forward to reading more of Ernaux’s work.  Cadence/pace/style is great. Personally was more interested in the beginning and end, especially where time and events overlapped with my life and experiences. Appreciated the translator footnotes expanding on French phrases, events, etc. though I will admit that after reading this I realized (once again) that my knowledge of global events and world history is poor.  A good companion to my trip to France. Glad I found it in that bookshop in Paris at the beginning of my vacation.","Ann"
"Annie Ernaux is very, very good at what she does. Her prose is beautiful and sweeping, and this book is filled with reflective insights about the process of aging, collective experience, and social history. Unfortunately, as a stinky American, there were a lot of French history and politics specific details that were lost on me. I found those sections harder to read, and later periods where history and memory became more globalized to be more familiar and thus resonant. That's not a flaw of the book itself--I'm not American enough to demand that the French author writing for a French audience write things that I understand, but it did detract from how much I might've enjoyed reading this. Perhaps to be revisited in the future, if I ever have any interest/inquiry into 1900s French sociopolitical history.","Sherry Wang"

"A discourse on her life but not as an autobiographical accounting. History provides the glue and the reason for the re-telling of memories. "there is no 'I' in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only 'one' and 'we', as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before". A photo of the maturing and aging Annie, different places and times, attitudes, appearance and history pull the book along chronicling her place in time and history - and ours. Necessary reading for those not of her time and to remember, as we are reminded, those of us on what I refer to as the downward slope, "...increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation".","Olivia"

"This one seemed to take me eons to finish. But I’m very happy it turned out this way. An incredible book, however… incredible in the way that you come to see with time. Perhaps like a cup of tea that never immediately overwhelms you but is laden with deep, comforting, rich, and insightful layers. I left this book sitting for quite some time before coming back to it and finishing. And this is when things really took off. At this point, I had uncovered the delight and ingenuity of Ernaux’s structure. Which left me seeping into the prose. Again, much like one can seep into a good cup of tea. The book is equally personal and impersonal. We all (as readers) reflect on the mind-boggling nature of time in our world. A lot of the cultural references were French (so I didn’t get everything). Nevertheless, the final pages led to shivers- one of my favorite experiences while reading. I’ll leave you with one of my favorite snags:  “She will go within herself only to retrieve the world…”.  Looking greatly forward to continue the Ernaux odyssey!","Claire M"
"Does this French book have tender reflections about memory? You bet. Does this collective memory of France read a bit like "We Didn't Start the Fire" en français, bellyaching lists of ephemera and cultural flotsam from a soixante-huitard? Sure, a bit, I confess I felt that way at the start. But once I let The Years in, let it get under my skin, then I found Ernaux's biography touching and beautiful, a catalogue of changing social mores, a lament for connections found and bonds lost. With a less capable writer, The Years would have come out like "we're so buried on our phones!" It's a testament to Ernaux's technique that one ends the book feeling differently. This is also one of the better books about racism against refugees and xenophobia that has become common in France (and elsewhere).  Takeaway: "What matters to her, on the contrary, is to seize this time that comprises her life on Earth at a given period, the time that has coursed through her, the world she has recorded merely by living."","no"
"yes you might think I am exaggerating, but to me Ernaux here represents a universal genius, or even in some ways the Simone De Beauvoir of our times. this book was also able to move me from beginning to end like almost no other until now. It is incredible how this writer almost managed to read my mind, making me relive my own life experiences, even though she is not the same age as me, even though we have not lived the same life.

"The Years (Noble Prize, maybe for freshness, its title lifted from Virginia Woolf) is a compelling long letter, reporting on a well-spent life, beginning in 1941. A non-stop, almost run-on compilation, from a journal and a box of photos. Written to whom, reporting to whom? Someone senior, close but not intimate, attentive but not judgmental, a brother? Grandmother? Does that person now (since Woolf) expect not only a woman’s personal, family and meteorological experiences in an autobiography, but its political and economic encounters as well? When you write your story honestly, do you write it to the person who turns out to be your god? Is it your last elevator pitch?","Thomas"
"An engaging read that I had to read in 20 or 30 page increments. There is much packed into 'The Years' by Ernaux. Her writing is full, with facts, politics, the changes in the world, and within herself. What an accomplishment to have captured as much as she does, of her life, the lives of those near and dear to her, as well as the upheavals of the world. I learned more about French politics and glimpses into America from her/their point of view.  This book propels me to read her previous works. Her stature as Nobel Prize Winner of Literature in 2022 was well appointed and deserved.","Kathleen Suess"
"Great idea for a book and interesting construction as based on a whole generation, rather than on a protagonist. But in the end this book is probably unreadable for someone who isn't a french person over the age of 65 if you want to get the references. And this book is all about the references. I'm french on my late 20s and found that a lot of references were quite spot on when she talks about the 90s-early 2000s, but I'm too young to understand most references from earlier on.","Ingrid"

Ernaux’s ability to share intensely personal memories from her life while holding you at a distance is masterful. The Years felt like flipping through her memory, an objective observer uncovering the past.  Unique and mind boggling for me as a writer!","Holly"
"I bought this book in French but while I did like it, I found the unstructured approach a bit difficult to read. There were no chapters, no divisions, just a long run on type of sentence.  Its an autobiographical account of the life of a French woman born in the 1940s and passing through every important historical and political event in France. While interesting, I found it tiring and would have preferred to have more context. If you dont happen to be a French woman born in the 1940s, you might only have vaguely heard of some of the historical events and the author jumps immediately into interpretation under the assumption that you HAVE the context.","Ruth Ann"
"Ernaux uses 'we' throughout this book. This is a collective history, and yet a very personal one. It's particularly weird when talking about the reasons why 'we' the women are considering divorce. The personal, political and social run into one another throughout and cannot be separated.    Occasionally, the reader is invited to observe 'she' a woman in a photo, not directly identified as the narrator. 'She' is on her family holiday.   Then there's a shift part way through, the writing still refers to 'she' but the nostalgia reveals that this 'she' is much closer to the person writing. She remembers different rooms she has slept in. 'She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence... an existence singular but also merged with the movements of a generation.' From here onwards the narrative of this generation is also threaded with the story of how 'she' became the author of this book.    It is a tricky read, but fascinating. One of the things I found most powerful - and most risky - was the way 'we' expresses racism and prejudice starkly and without comment. It was an uncomfortable read. An author would normally say that she no longer thinks these things, and would cast judgement on them. Instead Ernaux implicates herself and her whole generation, the whole mileau, in the shitty things people thought and said at the time. It feels quite radical, we're often so determined to forget how prejudice we once were, Ernaux isn't letting people get away with it.   It's the story of a culture growing more and more individualist, but the plural with which it's told, shows just how flimsy this belief in our individualism is.","Lauren"
"The Years is an amazing mix of memoir and an existentialist diary that focuses on memory and images, which stimulate memories both personal and the vicarious memories of others.  French author Annie Ernaux shares her memories and images from her birth to when she's 66. Her story includes clips of her life as part of events and trends that occurred in France and elsewhere until 2007. It compromises self-reflection as well as how she perceived what happened around her: politics, wars, fads, books, music, films, materialism. It's a look at a life lived and one that grapples with an unimaginable future that ends with death when memory ends.  This book may not appeal to readers who haven't lived in France or Europe, especially during the years she covers. If I hadn't lived in Europe and visited France and Paris during part of the time frame of Ernaux's book. Much of what she describes would have not resonated with me. That said, I recommend reading it anyway.","Frederick Fullerton"
"a book that is truly actually mind altering","James Cunningham"
""There was no ineffable world that leapt out from inspired words, as if by magic, and she would never write except from inside her language, which is everyone's language, the only tool she's ever intended on using to act upon the things that outraged her. So the book to be written represented an instrument of struggle. She hasn't abandoned this ambition. But now, more than anything, she would like to capture the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.

"Brilliant, I loved this as a student who takes a course in modern French history.","Robin Wik"
"This book is very focused on political and cultural changes from pre-WW2 to 2008. As the afterword describes, the changes are conveyed via the effect they have on an individual, though Ernaux's writing blurs the line between writing about herself vs. writing about a cohort of peers.  This study really scratches an itch for me; it's weirdly comforting to see the failures of May 1968 (which I guess is like a more serious French version of American hippies / Woodstock people?) traced to the disengagement and disappointment I feel with politics today.  The one big downside is that it's very French-focused. This lead me to some good new wikipedia articles, but made it a bit difficult to weigh the experiences of her life with my understanding of recent American history.  Throughout, there's a touching undercurrent of emotion, where through describing pictures of herself from her past and the images that are preserved in her memory, Ernaux grounds the impersonal set of events within her memory and experience.  All in all, really liked this. Probably would've loved it if I was from France.","Matt Munns"
"Took me awhile to get through this but that’s mostly as I wasn’t in the right mood for this book. Loved the narrative style where we went through the decades from right after world war 2 all the way into the first decade of the 21st century in France primarily and with a combo of pop culture and one woman’s memories of where her life was at and the big milestones she experienced over the course of her life in France.","Kelli Reddy"

"The web was the royal road for the remembrance of things past. Archives and all the old things that we'd never even imagined being able to find again arrived with no delay. Memory became inexhaustible, but the depth of time, its sensation conveyed through odor and the yellowing of paper, bent-back pages, paragraphs underscored in an unknown hand, had disappeared. Here we dwelled in the infinite present.  Our photographs and films-filed by date and viewed on screen, one after the other without a pause- were pervaded by the light of a time that was unique, no matter how diverse the scenes and landscapes. Another form of past came into being, fluid, with little real memory content. There were too many images for us to stop at each and recall the circumstances in which they were taken. Inside them, we lived a near weightless transfigured existence. The signs of our existence multiplied and put an end to the sensation of time marching on.","Paulina Grzybowicz"
"A fascinating journey through memory, history and time told equally through the smaller details of an ‘ordinary’ life and through the larger world events. Nothing like I’ve read before. It makes you more aware of the passage of time and the finer details in your own life that will end up contributing to your own memoir.","Phoebe C L"
"detached and holistic of a changing society yet also deeply intimate and perceptive of transformations in her own sense of the individual!

"This is a very unconventional book. Like the tittle suggest it is her observations from 1940, the year the author was born and 2006. You get so many little snippets of her life and for a writer that is very autobiographical you would expect a little more. No talk about her abortion, divorce, young lover and kids. She glances over them. But she dedicates a lot more to Algeria, muttered and French politics. She is a French writer but unless she is talking about 9/11 or national events like world War 2 it does feel kinda lost for me. If I were to write a book, I'm sure the French would feel the same way. A lot of American references and people would get lost. I love how unorthodox not your typical memoir and she explains why she wrote it with the we instead of I. It wasn't a page turner for me and at times I was engrossed in it. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars. I enjoyed her memoir about her father more.","Jose Gonzalez"
"Read it sometime last year, and then read it again. 4.5 stars.","Gülce"
"This book is a masterpiece. What an achievement to write such a small book full with a whole collective consciousness on the one hand and the dreams and the memories of one woman. There is so much information in this book, so many feelings and so many truths and it is written amazingly: the language just flows and takes you with it. It reads almost like poetry and in the same time is so literal; the descriptions of the photos for example: I had the feeling of a painting being paid in front of my eyes. Also the translation was superb!!! It made me realise how little credit the translators get. I almost never reread books, but I ll probably reread this in some time.","Christina"
"she IS electric","Aditi Somani"
"What a profound work of literature. Annie Ernaux layers her personal history over the history of the latter part of the 20th century. We see, think, and feel as she does during and after the liberation of France in 1945, experience the excitement/freedom of the sexual revolution of the 70s, the confusion of the technological advancements during the 80s-2000s. Political, economical, and social events are brought in and out of focus through her lens.  We simultaneously learn about Ernaux’s life as a student, wife/ex-wife, mother, author, occasional lover, pet owner (this had me bawling). At the end of this book, I was almost overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of human experience and also grateful for the lens Ernaux has provided to the world. I definitely want to keep a copy of this close by for reference.","Emily Purcell"
"I found this book puzzling - it didn't quite move me emotionally; intellectually, I can appreciate Ernaux's vast capability to track historical events throughout her life, and it's inspired me to consider keeping a journal of my own. I wonder if not being French and being unable to understand all these references is a reason why I've been handicapped, or if a great book (as this one is) should be able to reach me regardless.  Overall themes of Ernaux's are stretching beyond the personal "I" to situate herself (and women's lives) within the broader sociopolitical collective; the consumerization of society (contrast her rural upbringing with her urban adulthood), and increased secularization of France.","Jaybird1015"
"One of the best books i read this year. So amazing to get an inside look at life and the thinking process of people across such eventful decades. Also was fun to get the French perspective on the US. Really beautiful and moving.","Chamidae Ford"
"Incredibly voiced, presumably a very competent translation — Strayer conveys real rhythm which varies from recalled moment to recalled moment, whilst keeping the narrative voice clear and consistent. Strayer complements the Text with occasional footnotes clarifying references for the non-French.  I am not a French former teacher in her late 60s, but Ernaux so completely (and not necessarily always vividly, occasionally only requiring the briefest of passes) her's, and more generally, her generation's, combined lived experience.  I found it frequently challenging, as well as at points difficult to motivate my reading of it, but particularly its final half were easy to just ride through. It's difficult to say if the book was enjoyable to read per se, but I am glad to have read it & taken something from it.","Felix Thompson"

"This has a vivid record of how France is like after World War II. It is a good microscopic read a combined with the macroscopic descriptions: - Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II - Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945  The book mentions that people just forget lessons from history, and keep repeating cycles. It also mention facts such as the child death rate was pretty high previously, so it is normal for families to have 8 to 10 children, and maybe half survive. It also give descriptions of how schools was like how people pursue fashion and so on.","Zhijing Jin"
"It’s as if Ernaux has peered intently at life for decades and has figured out exactly how to translate how time, memory and zeitgeist work in writing. The writing is tender and brutal at the same time. The fragments are brief and to the point, deeply personal and recognisable at the same tjme. The effects of simply choosing ‘we’ over ‘I’ are far reaching and profound.","Hanneke"
"It could have been more personal.","Ayse"
"This is a gorgeous novel. An unconventional take on the memoir genre. The writing is beautiful. The book is however, too… French!  I’d claim to be a Francophile - but not THIS much. I had to do a lot of side-Googling while reading this, which always takes one out of their reading reverie.  Reading this book felt like watching two intellectuals reminiscing about the “good old days” - while you nod along and pretend to understand everything they’re saying.","Roop Gill Axelsen"
"This was one of the most unique memoirs I have ever read. Her writing style pulled me into the story, making me feel as though I were observing the passage of time. The omnipotent narrator simultaneously made certain moments feel frozen, while others felt as though they were passing at a blistering pace. There were so many incredible lines. This is a book with lots of sticky notes. The first pages of the book are immediately gripping. I skimmed over the first page and immediately bought it. It is incredibly clear why Ernaux won the Nobel Prize for literature. She is a writer one truly feels privileged to read.","Abby"
"intimidatingly brilliant","Lucie de Z"
"I can't say I "loved" this book, and I don't think that ever was the point but its "hybrid memoir" form channelling a time-lapse view of French history and the social and political changes that went with it through the lens of one woman's life is very difficult not to admire. It's a very inventive and expansive book at its best.","Kyle"
"A pretty full-on experience that took me a while to wrap my head around. The level of detail and 'signs of the times' flood you, but are also what make the book unique. Truly, it's a testament to Ernaux to be able to catalogue and reflect on all these nodes throughout the macro-context of her life and create an intuitive graphing of years.","William John Wither"
"I read this book in my mother tongue, which probably made it have a more personal impact, but I think this is an extraordinary autobiography. I could relate easily to a large part of it, even though I was not raised in the same timeframe and country as the author. But her commentary on family dynamics, on societal values and how they change, reflections on motherhood - it was all very familiar to me.","Ale Tz"
"There is no book like this one for the sensation of hurtling through time. Ingenious and transporting in its first person plural, its third person, its assertions and continuous discontinuities. Much to learn, here.  “The future is too immense for her to imagine. It will happen, that’s all.” (Annie Ernaux, The Years, 53)  “The increasingly rapid arrival of new things drove the past away. People did not question their usefulness, they just wanted to possess them and suffered when they didn’t earn enough to buy them outright.” (Ernaux, 83)  “She feels she has deviated from her former goals, as if her only progress in life were of the material kind. ‘I’m afraid of settling into this quiet and comfortable life, and afraid to have lived without being aware of it.’ Just as she makes this observation, she knows she isn’t ready to give up the things this diary never includes, the living-together, the shared intimacy, the apartment…” (Ernaux, 93)  “Now, everything once considered normal had become the object of scrutiny.” (Ernaux, 101)  “The discourse of pleasure reigned supreme. You had to feel pleasure while reading, writing, taking a bath, defecating. It was the alpha and the omega of human activities.” (Ernaux, 104)  “People were soothed by the arrival of the new. The certainty of continuous progress removed the desire to imagine it. New objects were no longer met with wonder or anxiety, but welcomed as additions to individual freedom and pleasure.” (Ernaux 141)  “With the Walkman, for the first time music entered the body. We could live inside music, walled off from the world.” (Ernaux, 142)  “Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express—a supreme and precious commodity.” (Ernaux, 145)  “Children, especially boys, had trouble leaving the family home with its well-stocked fridge, washed and folded clothes, and background hum of childhood. They made love in all innocence in the room next to ours. They settled into a protracted youth; the world wasn’t waiting for them. And by continuing to feed and care about them, we lived in a time that stretched back uninterrupted to their childhood.” (Ernaux, 165)  “And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.” (Ernaux, 188)  “She’s given up trying to deduce this form that is able to contain her life from the sensation she has on the beach with her eyes closed or in a hotel room, that sense of replicating herself and physically existing in several places she’s known over her life, and thus attaining a palimpsest time.” (Ernaux, 226)  “It will be a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life.” (Ernaux, 229)  “In the old days, when she tried to write in her student room, she yearned to find an unknown language that would unveil mysterious things, in the way of a clairvoyant. She also imagined the finished book as a revelation to others of her innermost being, a superior achievement, a king of glory.” (Ernaux, 229) ","Peter Rock"
"Beautifully written, very poetic. I would have gotten more out of it if I knew more French history...","Shannon"
"A book to keep on the shelf for its objective review of history from the 1960's. Navigating Ernaux's life through her words is relatable. The realization is that though Ernaux's history took place in France, it is relevant and clearly parallel to the U.S. and other countries.  ","Suzi Conklin"

"DNF I tried reading this at least 3 separate times over the last year. Each time I found I couldn’t stay with the book. I kept wanting something to ”happen”? I was waiting to become engaged? Finally-I decided to try and listen to it. I was able to get much further via audio book-but I found the same thing happening. The sentences were all eloquent-but because this is written as observations of life-no story, no characters-I again couldn’t stick with it. This could possibly be a book-that is best read in small sips? Like-a daily thought to digest?  Excellent sentences-but without a story to follow, or characters to relate to, I couldn’t hang in there for more.","Klynn"
"A monumental work of Ernaux, which for me comprises and simultaneously gives additional meaning and weight to many of her others - "A Girl's Story", "Happening", "A Frozen Woman", "Getting Lost"... Her ability to place herself precisely in a wider sociopolitical context is masterfully fused with her signature remaining utterly personal, inquisitive to self, revealing.","Agra Liege-Dolezko"
"Original and excellent.","Anna-Karin Hurtig"
"I strongly recommend this sweeping memoir by Nobel Laureate Annie Ernaux. It covers the period from 1940 through 2006. Set in France, it touches on the most arresting cultural, social and political turning points for entire generations. Thoroughly relatable for anyone alive today and perplexed by the rapid change to which we have all had to adapt.  It is also a sort of feminist testament from a woman who lived through a monumental revolution in women's rights throughout her lifetime. It is sad to see some recent setbacks to those rights in the United States. And while she does not talk about such legislation in the USA, a value of this book is how it triggers one's own memory and understanding of year's past.  Finally, while it was published in 2008, it manages to stay fresh and contemporary thanks to its very up to date commentary on our world's digital transition which has been several decades in the making.","Maribel Maldonado"
"Very unique and powerful. The prose is interesting in that while this book is autobiographical, it is presented in a way that comments on and describes the culture and societal dynamics surrounding the author through her life; spanning from the 1940s up to the 2000s in France, written in third-person. The author does this through her own perspective. In doing so, the author both writes about her own personal experiences as well as that of society as a whole. The book discusses various themes of feminism, romantic/familial relationships, politics, philosophies etc and how they have morphed through the 20th century and into the 21st. I have never read a book quite like it.","Jason Jones"
""Une fraiche tombait, un crepuscule."  Although I am neither French, nor a woman I find myself as drawn to this book as I was to "La femme gelee", when I was a University student... At the time I was studying Mai 68 and French Feminist writers including Annie Ernaux, Simone De Beauvoir, Colette and Marguerite Duras. For me Annie arrests me in a way that the other writers did not, maybe because she had two boys who must be a similar age to my brother and me. Yes I understand many of the references, have lived some of the same experiences, but I do not think you necessarily need to be in your 80s to think and feel as Annie does, to sense time slipping away and to marvel at the changes you have experienced. It is unusual to read an autobiography written in an almost alienated third person. Haunting.","Mr Alister Cryan"

"Profoundly moving. Just perfect.","Alison Brady"
"Not a review but a few thoughts after finishing this excellent book…  It is dizzying how much the society and way of living has changed during just one lifespan, and yet, the basic arc of life remains universal and unchanged.  Archetypal memories are shared and relived across people, societies, generations, and moments over one’s life but the individual details - the details that make them personal and unique - will disappear with each of us.","Honza Fedak"
"I struggled with this book, it’s literally “not for me.” There’s a lot of great writing, but if you don’t know a lot about French history/societal history from the 20th century, it’s hard to keep up with the constant unexplained references, even with the footnotes. The overall effect of the first person plural and sentence structure and historical references is that this book is an extended litany, broken up by a few scenes. I found the first and last chapters amazing. In the middle, I had to push myself to keep going and get through the monotony of the litany (which, I suppose, in some part, gets at an effect she wanted of time passing across a lifetime…). The translators note at the end was fascinating — some stuff that I didn’t like about the book was AE’s chosen style, some was a product of translation and the limitations of English vs. French. It made me wish I knew enough history and French to read this book in the original version, to really appreciate the ideas and experimental form of this book.","e"
"I keep thinking about the conceptual brilliance of this book. The notion of multiple selves, threaded "together with the story of her existence." The way individual memory shapes and is shaped by cultural signifiers and historical/political events to form a "common time," a means of showing how we (and the narrator) live within history.","Carolyn"
"I think Ernaux's autofiction works best the more removed from the moment of writing it is, closeness gives her a sort of strange and stark discomfort, as well as a lack of, well, I don't want to say charm since I don't think charm is what's lacking but, maybe a certain softness. Chunks of this are spectacular, chunks are a bit prickly. All in all a very good book, a great book even, just a step or two away from being exceptional and earth shattering.","Sara G"
"Manages to be a 'sweeping autobiography' by not being sweeping at all, instead focusing on minute, episodic details that comprise a fascinating mosaic of personal, political, social and cultural history. Will definitely read more by this author","Craig Winneker"

"This book has a slow start. I kept thinking it would become more engaging, but I found most of it boring except for a few flashes of insight.

"This was one of my favorite reads of the year. It’s is a pseudo memoir, spanning the time from 1941 to 2006, written both as a personal memoir while also the story of the world around the character, charting the social, political, and technological changes.. Annie Ernaux won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, and The Years is considered by many her magnum opus.  The writer’s self comes in and out of the narrative - sometimes she’s not there at all, only time and history. She pops in using we or they or one, but we recognize her as both a singular person and a person of her city, Paris, and generation. Time is marked by big events like a railway strike in 1953 and the fall of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. We read of fighting in Algeria, bit international events like the the building of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis, JFK’s assassination, Mao, the Beatles. The contextualization of life with history is jarring - proof of relative time. Sections of the story are introduced by photos, and later videos of a girl and her family, as if someone is flipping through an old album. It was unique and so beautifully written. I looked forward to reading this every day.  The writer/character describes when she first has the idea for what will become this book, after herd divorce: "Because in her refound solitude she discovers thoughts and feelings that married life had thrown into shadow, the idea had come to her to write ‘a kind of woman's destiny’ set between 1940 and 1986. It would be something like Maupaussant's A Life and convey the passage of time inside and outside of herself."  Later she describes the inseparability of the book from her life as, “She feels as if a book is writing itself just behind her; all she has to do is live. But there is nothing.”  As I’ve gotten older, I’ve questioned how one can distinguish between changes that are internal vs. external, i.e. which of my feelings have changed because I am an older person and changed my point of view vs. because the world I live in is different today than it used to be so the context for the question is different. This confusion is exacerbated when the world changes every day at a seemingly accelerating pace. This book both reinforced this ambiguity while also soothed me in the universalness of this experience.  Some of my favorite snippets, in order:  “While we did our homework at the kitchen table, the ads on Radio Luxembourg, like the songs, brought certainty of future joy, and all around us we felt the presence of absent things we’d be allowed to buy later.”  “The figure is too immense for her to imagine, it will happen, that’s all.”  “In the privacy of our rooms, we engaged in solitary orgies of playing the same disc over and over. It was like a drug that blew the mind away, smashed the body, and opened a whole new world of love and violence, inseparable from surboums, those unbridled parties we interminably longed to attend.”  “A feeling common to women was on its way out, that of natural inferiority.”  “The new way of being was ‘laid-back,’ and feeling good about oneself, a mixture of self-assurance and indifference to others.”  “This year, for the first time, she seized the terrible meaning of the phrase I have only one life.”  “As we aged, we ceased to have an age.”  “Pride in what one did was substituted for pride in what one was–female, gay, provincial, Jewish, Arab.”  “We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be.”","Eleanor Golightly"
"“But now, more than anything, she would like to capture t the light that suffuses faces that can no longer be seen and tables groaning with vanished food, the light that was already present in the stories of Sundays in childhood and has continued to settle upon things from the moment they are lived, a light from before.”","emily"
"this was a perfect book. i dont actually wanna read anything but annie ernaux right now. it was so good and beautiful. its literally everything - a whole entire life. and what a way to tell the story of a woman’s life: here are the things that happened, here’s how we lived, here’s our history and every once in a while, here’s how i felt about it. honestly, the “here’s how i felt about it” parts are my favorite. i love the way she can bring about past feelings and look at them with clarity and kindness but without creating too much meaning from them. i dont know that ive ever felt more seen/related to something more than her writing. also makes me want to write again (and write like her). all in all, i feel like a much more complete person after reading the years.","isa"

"Save something from the time where we will never be again","Eline"
"“…memory never stops. it paired the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history”.” there is something marvelous that occurs in the universe when annie ernaux writes. in a whirlwind, ernaux takes us through the years, growing up in France, time at university, and finding first love amid a tapestry of global events that speak to our collective consciousness. all the while, ernaux expands the focus outward, litigating, blurring, and augmenting the boundaries between the personal and the shared. yet, while she is, herself, unequivocally apart of history, she is also apart, seeing herself as a composition of fragments that are utterly her own, that are simply other. what shines through in the text, also, is the ceaseless, unending feeling of possessing way too many thoughts and nowhere to put them. ernaux’s voice has always hit close to home because it wields that distinct flare that makes faraway things seem close. “What matters to her, on the contrary,” Ernaux writes at the end, “is to seize this time that comprises her life on Earth at a given period, the time that has coursed through her, the world she has recorded merely by living.”","Carson Sheinberg"
"wow! completely exceeded my expectations. ernaux’s style—which is self-consciously common, expected, and non-inventive—reads as a revelation. a language of self that is not of the self but rather of her generation, or rather of her consumer age bracket.  ernaux seems to be divisive in my friend group, but i found the years to be a joy! ernaux writes in a common language—both in expression and in voice. always a “we,” ernaux expresses nothing new on the level of the sentence… but expressing the common beliefs over the course of sixty years shows the historically determined nature of our most intimate actions and beliefs. ernaux’s voice constantly updates with the times… as do her politics, tastes, fears, etc. everything, from her divorce to her relationship with her kids, is mediated by consumer culture. ernaux’s even-keeled voice of quiet agony portrays this perfectly.  near the end, ernaux take a misstep, attempting to turn her novel, insightful style into a one-two punch. she claims the history-personal (as opposed to the inverse, a “personal history”) to be, despite its overdetermination by consumerism, fundamentally worthwhile as a window into the self. she sees through the holes in the curtain, finding small rays of light—of the Authentic Real—peaking through. but her account seemed to betray just the opposite! it seems much more effective as a detailed account of the curtain pulled over all of our eyes, precluding us from an experience with the authentic.  but perhaps my cynicism is unwarranted (as ernaux suggests in an offhanded reference to houellebecq[but wouldn’t this be in the voice of the public? i’m confusing myself, now!]), or my marxism too vulgar, and i am merely upset with this shift in the book on a formal level—as a detour into the individual, authorial voice from the voice of the bourgeois masses. for ernaux to come out at the end and have sincerely held beliefs on aesthetics feels a bit jarring, be it for ideological reasons or aesthetic ones!","Jackson Kelley"
"Just a little bit too ethereal for me - I like some form of storyline, but I am sure others will enjoy. Closer to poetry than prose to my ears.","JoJo"
"I really loved the form of the book. The repetitive use of old pictures, scenes from dinner tables, social action, fads, and general “newsworthy” items really laid the framework for a neat memoir.","Adam Carrico"
" if i had three wishes from a genie, i think i would use at least one of them on being able to read books in their original language. i know i complain about this constantly but for ernaux it feels especially important. the translators note acknowledges the difficulty in capturing the author’s use of the ‘je collectif’ and its role in maintaining the rhythm of her writing. i would love to experience ‘the years’ as god intended.  once i got used to her style, i got completely immersed in this book and read it in one sitting (read: a 2.5 hour flight where my phone was on airplane mode). it’s not that the plot is particularly gripping or defined, but that i was eager to see how she would continue to weave the themes of time and memory into the narrative.  this memoir doesn’t feel personal, and yet it is highly specific. it is a catalogue of changing tastes and perceptions and the impact it has had on her (and women generally).  add this to your stack if you’re looking for something a little different. i have to say it was an excellent complement to fear of flying.  winter break is literally my super bowl so everyone buckle up; more reviews are coming.","Emma Santucci"
"I wanted to read at least one of her books since she won the Nobel Prize for Literature - this book is observations over the years of her life. No chapters.

"This book really affected me. It was interesting to read about the war years and the time directly following them, and to read about the years around my birth. I lived through a lot of what Ernaux described. It also made me sad as I am now in my late sixties and identified with much of what she wrote about a woman in later life.","Kim Russell"
"3.5 Kaleidoscopic book. The array that she captures of the intertwined political and personal is pretty incredible, but the lack of singular driving characters made it difficult to stick with after a while.","Conor Sweetman"
"I listened to the abridged version of this on BBC sounds. I MUST now read the full book as I simply love everything written by Annie Erneaux. I'm not sure exactly what it is about her writing that fascinates me and draws me in to her world. Her rich prose and almost lyrical writing always takes me to the place and scene she is setting and I can imagine myself there.  The book spans the timeframe from Annie Erneaux's birth in 1940 up to 2006. It isn't a straightforward autobiography- she uses “we”, which sometimes shifts into the third person, so the author appears as “she”. This seems to be as close as we get to this great author. I can't wait to read the full book. I have given this 4* as its hard for the BBC abridgement (excellent though it is) to do this book justice.","Debby Binns"
"I am pretty sure The Years is one of the most perfect books of all time. There is a reason Annie Ernaux has a Nobel.","Courtney Mosier Warren"
"Before I say anything about this book, full disclosure I am a huge admirer of Ernaux’s work. So my thoughts are completely biased, and I’m fine with that.  ‘The Years’ marks the last of Ernaux’s works I’ve read published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (I know there are few others out there not by published by Fitzcarraldo, so I’ll now have to seek them out), and I do feel like I’d saved the best till last.  As with the majority of her work, it takes the memoir form; but it’s so much more than that. It’s an extremely erudite summery of the years between 1941 to 2006, including in some way almost pretty much everything that happened politically between those years, the social changes, people’s way of life and not least of course how the world has felt and changed for women. It’s a breathtaking achievement.  Ernaux has in effect created her own genre of memoir, chronicling the events of her life, capturing the passing of time. Highly recommended!","od1_40reads"
"I feel a bit lost in the 4-5 star reviews here and all the word-of-mouth recommendations that told me this was 'hard but worth it'. I found it incredibly difficult to connect with this book and not even because I found it intellectually complex or a particularly laborious read. Ultimately, I think it came down to the fact that I don't have a general knowledge (or strong interest in) French history and culture. As a linguist by training with an interest in Translation Studies, I can imagine it's engaging and thought-provoking as a French speaker, but unfortunately there were but a few moments of illumination in the book that provoked me to feel a kind of affinity with the world the narrator was describing, which is what I had really hoped for from it. And, what's more, I found the translation incredibly distracting; I appreciate the need for the footnotes given the esoteric nature of a lot of the content, but they drag you quite forcefully out of the flow of the narrative, and I also found the text to be littered with Americanisms that felt confusing.  I would be inclined to see it as a book that perhaps just doesn't work in translation (or at the very least unless you have a prior knowledge or engagement with French/France), but the supposedly 'feminist' perspective of the narrative also bothered me. The idea of a social history through the personal is really interesting to me but I don't think it worked in practice here because the voice is so obviously, so painfully, white and middle-class. Perhaps this is what the author intended, and wanted to draw attention to this, but I found it unconvincing. References to France's imperial past (and present) intended to be self-aware fell flat and throwaway comments to heroes like Bourdieu felt just that - throwaway - in the voice of a narrator who was so clearly untouched and only sympathetic, rather than empathetic, to struggles beyond their privileged realm. Being clumped into the 'we', the collective history, to a perspective I don't share, was irritating, and I find attempts to illuminate a feminist agenda that don't go beyond simply correcting middle-class women's experiences of society, so that they feel a bit more comfortable, tired and outmoded.  Overall, despite my thoughts, I can really understand why people like this book. I even love the concept, the idea of memoir that's simultaneously social history. However, I'm not sure it's quite as flawlessly wonderful as some of the reviews and recommendations suggest. ","Elle"
"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. The genre is not usually something I read but I read the whole book within a day because I just wanted to know more. It’s a great piece.","merve"
"3.5 a depersonalized stream of consciousness following decades of political and cultural events. intriguing form for a autobiography but a bit too fragmented and cold to truly captivate me as a reader","martyna"
"Initially, when I started reading this book, without much prior research, this stream of consciousness took me by surprise, and felt it was too much before starting a story. Until I realized all of this is THE story.  Since I am a history enthusiast, especially local, small histories, I loved how she traversed different eras and eras and encapsulated the essence of each one. Her intention to document these fleeting moments and emotions from a bygone era, now lost in the annals of time, struck a chord.  ‘Save something from the time where we will never be again.’  I admire writers who become so intimate in their writing. Annie is sharing a lot of personal memories, about family, war, aging, being a woman, family stories, the culture. But not only that, because everything is used in order to shape a collective history of ideas & feelings/sensation that usually go unnamed, (like the peculiarity of seeing yourself on the camera for the first time in that era, hearing your own voice, etc) as she has beautifully put it: ‘This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen—perhaps nothing compared to those her granddaughter will see, as will all beings who are alive in 2070. To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.’  I like that is is always trying to offer the social, political, and cultural landscape through which she moved in the years she refers to. In a way, the whole book it's a very good radiography of a country moving culture, and as time moves forward along with globalization, it's more about the world than a country.  Because of that, I feel that I need to say I love writers who are giving credit to the places that made them because I do believe the places make a lot of our beings. And so, now I need to go to Paris for Annie, along with Naples for Elena Ferrante and Mangalia for Cella Serghi. That is how I know, that a writer will stay with me. They will even torment me, because I get the obsession to try to live through their filter, to see with their eyes, to breathe the smells of the places they describe. I love writers who have a kind of precise, almost surgical lucidity with which they write, about their worlds. I felt that with Annie more than with Elena, as much as I love Ferrante.  It's the things that I think as well, but I can’t quite articulate myself that easily and so draw me so much to them and make me appreciate them so much. The little thoughts, and feelings that go untold, but which all together make a collective history. For example, this bit about the impossibility of aging in this capitalist-consumerist culture, a thought I had myself as well, a collective thought that is a ‘meme-template’ nowadays on Instagram and tiktok about how 25+ years feel as they are still 20-something.  'And we did not age. The things around us didn’t last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn’t have time to associate them with moments of existence.”  I loved how the pace of the book started so slowly consistent with the times she was writing about. Starting with the post-war sorrow and austerity, speed increasing gradually in sync with our modern consumerist era. She feels the passing of time changed due to being perpetually engaged in a world demanding their constant presence, an unending cycle of consumption and technological evolution; she feels the following: ‘The moon, when we looked up at night, shone fixedly on billions of people, a world whose vastness and teeming activity we could feel inside. Consciousness stretched across the total space of the planet toward other galaxies. The infinite ceased to be imaginary. That is why it seemed inconceivable that one day we would die.’  Her reflections on liberty resonated as well, underscoring our contemporary indifference toward a once-cherished principle, which we don’t bother to question today, being contemptuous of the illusion of liberty we have today (of choosing; what to buy, how to dress, etc).  In the end, I couldn't help but contemplate how history, in a peculiar way, has shrunk, has become small, and we no longer look back. I never thought I would be saying that history (or collective feelings & history) repeats itself would apply to our technological era. But it seems technology has nothing to do with the feelings it evokes.  Being caught up in the urgent present that we are facing, we believed and we believe that we are living in unprecedented times, and WE DO, but the feeling of confusion and overwhelm was there before us.  'The media took charge of the process of memory and forgetting. It commemorated everything that could be commemorated, the appeal of Abbé Pierre, the deaths of Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras, the beginnings and ends of wars, the first step on the moon, Chernobyl, September 11. Every day was the anniversary of something, a law, a crime, the opening of a trial. The media divided time into the yé-yé years, the hippie and the AIDS years. It divided people into generations, De Gaulle, Mitterrand, ’68, ’boomers, the digital generation. We belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.'  'We were mutating. We didn’t know what our new shape would be’  …  'If we tried to enumerate the things that happened outside us, after September 11 we saw a rash of swift-moving events, a series of expectations and fears, interminable times and explosions that paralyzed or deeply distressed us—“nothing will be as it was before” was the dominant theme—and then disappeared, forgotten, unresolved, and commemorated a year or even a month later, as if they were ancient history. There was April 21, the war in Iraq, which fortunately did not include us, and the death of John Paul II, another pope whose name we hadn’t retained, let alone his number, the bombing of the Atocha station, the great festive evening for the No vote in the European Constitution referendum, the incendiary nights of rioting in the banlieue, Florence Aubenas, the London terrorist attacks, the Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Saddam rooted out of a hole and hanged (no one knew when), nebulous epidemics, SARS, avian flu, the chikungunya virus. During the summer that brought the big heat wave, American soldiers were sent home in bags from Iraq, and little old men and women who died from the heat were stacked in refrigeration chambers at the Rungis market'.  'Everything seemed overwhelming. The United States was the master of time and space, which it occupied according to its needs and interests. Everywhere the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer. People slept in tents all along the Boulevard Périphérique. The young sneered “Welcome to a world of shit” and briefly rebelled. Only the retired were satisfied, and sought advice on how to save and spend their money, traveled to Thailand, shopped on eBay, and visited Meetic online dating. Where could revolt come from?’","Oana Mocanu"

"“When it comes to her mother, she remembers the eyes, the hands, the silhouette; the voice, only in the abstract, without texture. The real voice is lost; she has no concrete remnant of it. But phrases often rise to her lips spontaneously, the same ones her mother used in the same contexts, expressions she didn’t remember ever using herself, “The weather is sluggish,” “He talked my ear off,” “You have to wait your turn, like at confession,” etc. It was if her mother were speaking through her mouth, and with her an entire lineage. Other phrases come into her head sometimes, the ones her mother used after she got Alzheimer’s. Their incongruity revealed her mother’s altered mental state, “You can bring me some rags to wipe my bottom with.” In a flash, her mother’s body and presence are returned to her. Unlike the former sentences, repeatedly used, the latter are unique, forever the preserve of one sole being in the world, her mother.”","Catchingfire"

"i am so glad i found this! it’s really difficult finding good books in english in bookstores here, i couldn’t believe it when i saw an annie ernaux book all by itself, like it was waiting for me! and to find it near the end of the year… it was perfect timing.  this book nearly brought me to tears multiple times. she writes about everything so gently, and so truthfully! the parts about the woman when she was in her twenties really, really shot through me. her life isn’t similar to mine, i’m not married, i’m not having kids any time soon, but i want to write too, and i fear what she fears, and what she fears comes true! this being a young girl and feeling as if it had been wasted and then becoming a young adult and feeling the weight of who you will become when you look at your mother and any older women, this metamorphosis from a girl to a ‘mother’, and when you are a mother you very nearly lose yourself! you feel guilty to let yourself think about yourself, write about yourself! it all hurt so badly to read. it reminded me of my mother of course and it expressed all i fear but hate to think about and express because it feels so disrespectful towards my mother and it feels dangerous to resist who i might become, because if i do become that, i might be even more miserable having previously resisted it. i’m just rambling. she says this all eloquently, with these beautiful pictures!  i cared little for the collective parts later in the book, when technology came in, and 9/11… it’s just old to me, but i know this book is written in a way that is very conscious of future readers, 2080 she says? or 2070? so they won’t feel the same. i don’t know i don’t have anything coherent to say having just finished it, and it really was a lot. i’ll go back to it often. it’s as hopeful as it is.. sad, i guess.","maya"

"Me and the Nobel prize committee will recommend Annie Ernaux to anyone. I know this is the peak of her collective history/autofiction thing BUT personally I prefer her shorter books that focus on a specific thing more. Passion simple, l’événement, la femme gelée, regarde les lumières mon amour all do this incredible cultural-history-through-her-own- life in a way that feels more precise. They offer her perspective on having a crush, being a slut, supermarkets, the inevitable trap of domesticity etc, in a way that feels raw and relatable. But this one felt less accessible and more indulgent in boomer exceptionalism. I just didn’t love it as much so I’m more recommending the others than hating on this one.","Cat"
"Haunting - a deeply personal memoir and simultaneously "a collective autobiography" of a generation with a deeply intimate prose style. She often uses "we, she, us, one"...but not "I."  At times, it's a plodding record of the passage of time without a distinct story/plot... It's often unsentimental and distant, yet centralizes photographs and gatherings for snapshots in time, sprinkled with very personal details, to create dichotomous intimacy. Very much worth the read.","Kaitlin Page"

"It's well written, absolutely no doubt about that, the sentences skip through events linking them together in a seamless way that carries you along and all with nice simple words. The problem is that I'm not French so while the private events in the woman's life are interesting enough the cultural references to French TV, French personalities, French politicians and French everything else just washed over me in tides of boredom that made the book difficult to enjoy.  When I moved to Spain I set about learning the language, some history, background information - trying to settle in. What immigrants can never do adequately is learn about that everyday culture - the songs that the home population learned at school, the songs that seeped in because they were popular and always on the radio, the changing face of high street shops, the non famous personalities like newsreaders and minor politicians the names of all the different cakes. If I'd moved to France I could have used this book as a manual for that type of everyday cultural history for a longish time frame.","Chris Thompson"

"A narrative history of personal, political, national and international events from 1941 up to 2006, through memories, moments of history, and personal commentary. A rich and generous autobiographical archive, that is indeed of the time.  From war and rations, through the national political choices of the day. The moments of world triumph and horror, progress and repetition. From the collapse of the Berlin Wall, to the appearance of the computer. The fizz of Y2K, the demise or crumble of other nations, the battles. French political faces, times of hardship and economic downturn, to crucial world events that changed us all.  Having read much of Annie Ernaux's oeuvre this year, this final volume has included a recap and reconfigure of the key moments including her childhood, the moment of shame between her parents, her abortion, her loves, the death of her father, her elicit affairs, being a carer to her mother. These are all placed in the chronology of this comprehensive but engaging history.  Spliced by the vivid description of a photograph of herself, in a time and place, in the fashion of the day, in a setting and moment captured, this pause each time brings us back to Annie within the timeline.  Told in the third person, this allows a critique of the time, within the reflection. Placing Annie in these moments, with a degree of distance. She also shares some of her thoughts on process about coming at this very book.  A brilliant capture of a life, the times ever changing. A reflection of the passing of time, the growth and change of a person, a nation, a world community. A memorable little volume of a life really lived.","Natasha (jouljet)"
"It was difficult to get through. However, I want to tackle it again in the future. The writing style was unlike any th thing I had read before. I think the second reading will be quite enjoyable.","Tammie Allen"
"Ernaux's magnum opus and the crown to her body of work.  A 'faceless' autobiography from the French female perspective commencing in post world war II Europe.  When posting the question, why should this stimulate the author to win the Nobel prize, is probably pertinent to note the recurring themes of the French respect for women, their bodies, and their right to abortion; not to mention their embrace of community over consumerism.  There's unlikely to be a Hollywood release any time soon.  I loved it. ","Chris Brady"
"4.5 stars, docked half a star for the fact it took me 7 months to get through and also because i just know it would hit different if i read it in french, but i also have no desire to do so  this was fabulous? there was a point where i thought i might give up on it, but i am so glad i persevered. like i know she won the nobel prize for literature and all but i wasn’t expecting it to feel so important. there’s an urgency about it, a desperation to record life as it has been lived that i think only comes after having lived for such a long time, and through so much. it was macro and micro, moments of huge social and worldwide consequence and moments of tiny insignificance that profoundly impact one’s life. it was snapshots and photographs and a real palimpsest of time that twists and folds over itself.  i loved how french it was, which sounds silly. and i loved its self-awareness. unraveling in the present tense with an awareness that it has already ended. i also loved the political side of it. the quote about how they believed they paved the way for political reform and revolution tickled me too…’we had the impression that all the world’s revolts and revolutions were our handiwork, from the eradication of slavery to the shipyards of Gdańsk and Tinananmen Swuare. There before us were all the peoples of the earth, every struggle of the past, present and future, all progeny of the French Revolution.’  ‘Time of an unknown nature takes hold of her consciousness and her body too. It is a time in which past and present overlap, without bleeding into each other, and where, it seems, she flickers in and out of all the shapes of being she has been.’","meg fitzwater"

"Really stunning, some of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read are contained in this novel. A unique way of storytelling, History (capital H) as a collective memory grounded in our individual experiences. Ernaux is searching for that lost time, or as she writes herself: "To save something from the time where we will never be again."  A story that begins in the shadow of World War II and ends with children playing the Nintendo Wii. Truly to have grown up in this period of time is unique and exceptional in the Human experience - even from our arrogant posing in the 21st century with all our gadgets and received wisdom it cannot be denied how Historically, socially, individually exceptional a life between c. 1949-2008 would have been. (Part of this is how it feels like Time has become Flattened by the advent of social media, the digital world et al - can we really say we can differentiate between 2010 and 2019? Perhaps, actually, but I'm skeptical as of right now)  Stunning passages that are intimately familiar to myself (as a damned 'Gen Z') - globalisation, societal decay at the end of history, the dizzying effects of limitless consumption and digitalisation. "We never stopped wanting to click on 'save' and keep all the photos and films, viewable on the spot. Hundreds of images were scattered to the four winds of friendship, a new social use of photos [...] What mattered most was the taking of the photos, existence captured and duplicated, recorded was we were living it [...] With digital technology, we drained reality dry."  The chunk of time spent on the late 50s through to the 60s-70s were, of course, my favourite passages. Vivid, loved, large, and most of all feeling ~important~. Figures that I have only ever seen in the past tense are living and breathing in this period - Camus, De Beauvoir, Barthes, Anna Karina, Godard - until they aren't, and they are mourned. Can you believe a million people walked behind Sartre's coffin?  Big recommend ","Jared"

"“To write is to fight forgetting.”  I’ve been wanting tor read Annie Ernaux for a long time at the urgent recommendation of my French housemate, though the minimalist covers of the Fitzcarraldo editions that never failed to grab my attention during my weekly bookshop trips also played a role. I’m glad I finally caved in to their appeal.  What I discovered in the writing of Annie Ernaux was something profound, made even more so by the simplicity of the style and stunning insights. “The Years” is a narrative recollection of events between 1941 to 2006, through the lens of the french author herself that uses mediums such as memory, photographs, impressions, language, songs, radio and television to portray the collective memory of her generation - something of a collective biography. In it I found  something forever relevant not only in France but everywhere, not only to her generation but every generation  “In the mid-1950s, at family meals, teenagers remained at the table. They listened but did not speak, smiled politely at the jokes that were not funny, the approving comments whose object was their physical development, the salty innuendos designed to make them blush, and answered only their cautious questions about their schoolwork.”  something ever-pervasive, ever present: the passing of time measured not by clocks, but by the changing attitude of people toward politics, gender roles, religion, sex  “Sex was the root of all society’s suspicions. People saw it everywhere, in everything: low necklines, tight shirts, red nail polish, black underwear, bikinis, the fraternising of the sexes, the darkness of cinemas, public toilets, the muscles of Tarzan, women who smoked at crossed their legs, girls who touched their hair in class, etc. It divided girls into a “proper” and “improper” kind. The moral rating posted on the church door for the weekly films was based on sex and sex alone.”  something recurring whereby historical contexts shape individual and national Identity (with capital I)  “Identity, which until then had meant nothing but a card in one’s wallet with a photo glued onto it, became an overriding concern. No one knew exactly what it entailed. Whatever the case, it was something you needed to have, rediscover, assume, assert, express - a supreme and precious commodity.”  something about people, being and having, existence - the transient sensations that are impossible (yet here made possible) to communicate.","Alina Lucia"
"5 stars; a masterful and unusual memoir that still manages to be poignant and funny  If a droplet of water could write a memoir, how would it distinguish its actions from those of the ocean? It probably couldn't and that seems to be the guiding principle behind Ernaux's The Years too which tells a memoir of the history of all women from postwar France to the present rather than focusing much on the personal life of its author. Told in relentless, stylish, and surprisingly funny 1st person plural, The Years really makes you feel the toll and exhausting procession of time despite its short length. I've never read a book quite like this before but found myself completely riveted. My only minor qualm is that the story occasionally dips into a metafictional element where Ernaux contemplates how certain periods of time should be represented in the final book and I'm not convinced it adds all that much to the story but at least it doesn't take much away either since these interjections are brief. All in all, it's quite an amazing book and I can only imagine how much better it must be in the original French since the translator's note really made clear how difficult it was to correctly translate the tenses and pronouns of the narration.","Kevin James"
"When she copies down sentences that tell one how to live, which have the undeniable weight of truth because they come from books: There is no real happiness except that which we are aware of while we are feeling it.  The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.  The ideals of May '68 were being transformed into objects and entertainment.  And we did not age. The things around us didn't last long enough to grow old, replaced and rehabilitated at lightning speed. Our memory didn't have time to associate them with moments of existence.  Of all the new objects the "mobile phone" was the most miraculous and disturbing. Never had we imagined being able one day to walk down the street with a phone in our pocket and call anyone, anywhere, at any time. it was strange to see people talking to themselves on the street, a phone pressed to one ear.  We graduated to the DVD player, the digital camera, the MP3 player, ADSI, and the flat screen. We never ceased to upgrade. The failure to do so meant saying yes to aging. Gradually, as the skin started to show its years and the body to feel the effects of time, the world showered us with new things. We in our decline and the world, marching on, were going in opposite directions.","Melrose"
"It took me a relatively long time to read this short book. Which is fitting, since years pass slowly. At the same time the book is also relentless, almost unsettlingly so, in how time passes in it, and in how it ages the author and changes society. The author seems to have a different experience of time and memories than I do, which in itself is interesting. Her memories seem sharper than mine, and where I am often overtaken by crippling nostalgia, she seems to revel in, or at least be fascinated by, the experience of being present in multiple times simultaneously. At times the enumeration of societal events seems excessive, but overall the book is wonderful; it is that kind of book that presents you with something that is new and fresh (a new form, language, type of narrative) yet once you see it, it is entirely obvious and just works. Something that just works, yet is entirely new, that is always going to seem a little magical.","Gustav"
"This is not a long book, but it took me seemingly forever to finish it. On the one hand, I admire the almost encyclopedic catalogue of the shifting social, cultural, political norms of France in the years between 1940 and 2006. If you are not French, you will certainly not be familiar with some of the references made in every page, which is OK or can be annoying depending on your point of view. The narrative also switches often from "she" to "we," as it shifts back and forth between an individual woman's experiences and those of society as a whole. While the breadth and scope of Ernaux's undertaking is laudable, I did not really enjoy reading this compared to her other works.","Andres Eguiguren"
""She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas, and manners, and the private life of this woman? How to make the fresco of forty-five years coincide with the search for a self outside of History, the self of suspended moments transformed into the poems she wrote at twenty (“Solitude,” etc.)?"","Peyton"

"An incredible achievement. A language so crystalline you cannot only find your reflection but an entire society's. Annie Ernaux's voice is vivid and tenacious, imperturbable and moving is this portrait of a women and a nation, from postwar to 2006 France. Annie Ernaux compounds the breadth of a historian and the insight of a biographer, melancholic and lyrical like the writer she is, with her usual dense and visually arresting prose, which impresses to every colon and semicolon, interjection and conjugation a life of their own.","Amanda Rosso"
"The book had some interesting elements. However, I found it difficult to get into and more difficult to stay invested in. There weren’t any specific characters, I understand that is by design but not the style for me. Would be enjoyable for someone who likes a broad story centred around cultural and social changes.","Brooke Allan"

"A very subjective 2.5…. Too many French references lost on me","Jovana"
"i do see how good of a writer annie ernaux is but the structure of the book was too boring for me. i liked the description of the photos and how the memories would lace together throughout her narrative. however, in the end, it is just someone's perception of the passage of the years. too many french references i was absolutely clueless about and some of the magic was lost there for me. even though the author makes it easier for the reader to connect with her constantly., it is not a story per se, but maybe a collection of memories, and i wish i had known that before starting this book, maybe it would have given me a different perspective. took me way too long to finish, dense paragraphs, lack of a single conducting line and lack of climax. not my favorite, it is definitely not for me.","Sarah"
"Such an interesting read. The form of the book feels like you're floating through someone else's memories like they are your own.

"I feel as if I read a school history book of almost the whole 20th century, but one that said “world wars happened, you know that already, here’s everything else”.  And this is not to be criticism! There’s simply such a dazzling amount of detail, of past and events and headlines mixed with incredibly intimate memories that the weight of it is tangible.  Enjoyable but a lot to take in. And indubitably I missed many many things that only the French (or only those alive then?) can understand.  Pisteet vielä Laura Toivasen suomennokselle - todella hyvä!","Elsary"
"I really can't improve on the fine review by Adam Dalva. This memoir was a nostalgic journey for me, reviving my memories of visiting, then living in France during the 60s - early 70s.

Now I need to read them in the original, and have ordered 'Les Années'.","Carole Hazell"

"Really, really enjoyable. A life in France, while exploring memory, individuality, aging, so much. Though easy to read, it's a slow read, because of so many thoughtful perspectives offered. She runs from childhood to retirement, with studies in photos marking the progression. Very enjoyable, though many references to French experiences.","Aaron"

"I found the listening long, it didn’t catch me. I wonder if it would have been different if I read? The book is about some random person/people, their mifes through out the years. The author links these lives to events or what is happening on their world / french world. The end of the book caught my attention though. A few sentences that resonate with me because of what ir described or reminded me of. When we meet our relatives for a family meal, we chit-chat asking what people have been doing, this is a mandotory step in these reunion, we mis actualise ourselves on the others. Or a child to be born (the character was going to be a grand mother, was the first), means that you are soon to be replaced in the world, she was then in between two periods, a confirmed birth and her possible death. If I’m to read another of her books, I think I’ll read. (Or was it a monotonous tone in the reading that made the book lack of enthousiasm?)","Jussara"
"This was a very clever and interesting read. A personal memoir written as a collective experience that recounted the social history of France. I like how it mentioned the political and popular culture changes from 1940s (Annie’s birth) to 2007. It was drawing upon events over that time but also was cleverly written through photo snapshots and memory. I found it a challenging read at first because I haven’t read something like this before, but I eventually picked up on it and began to read with more of an understanding. I have it 4 stars mainly for its clever structure, and expansive vocabulary. The reason why it is not quite 5 stars is because it could get repetitive at times and confusing when you aren’t familiar with this fancy literature style/creative choices!","Chelsea Hauser"
"A unique take on a memoir / autobiography. I would have given it a 5 star if I had been French; for me the many references to books, films etc that had no relevance for me became tedious","Anne Leeming"
"It took me a while to figure out what she was doing, so I had a slow start. But once I got it, I found it very enlightening. To listen to the way her life unfolded alongside the unfolding of history was a true pleasure. I thought it was a brilliant choice to use the pronoun 'we' or 'one' (much of the time) because it made me think of her as an example of a larger phenomenon. But, on the other hand, it kept me at a bit of a distance. I'm excited to read more by Annie Ernaux.","Callie"
"Incredible use of the first person plural to draw a reader in and feel like they are moving through the six decades with the narrator. Densely packed with references to contemporary culture, including a great focus on politics, this book manages to also not get bogged down and read like a Wikipedia timeline. The progression of time happens without you noticing as you read the book, suddenly arriving at the “present day”. Shows how far societal ideas have come, especially around expectations of women, and also how little has changed in the bigger picture.","Kirsten Diamond"
"Absolutely fascinating day to day insight into French life. Wonder if there is anything similar set in UK. Quite a way to write a memoir and very much immediate style and witness accounts.","Georgina"
"I'm so tired and she gets it. A mix of history, biography, and memoir tied together with a coquette bow. I have work to do but I am in love with her writing, I wanna read more but I am not paying 21.31 bucks for a 2-hour audiobook. I am losing my mind but my wallet is still sane! Okay goodbye party people, slime up.  Fav quote: “—the images, real or imaginary, that follow us all the way to sleep —the images of a moment, bathed in a light that is theirs alone  They will vanish all at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. Images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. And one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. Like sexual desire, memory never stops. It pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.”","tom"

""What matters to her, on the contrary, is to seize this time that compromises her life on Earth at a given period, the time that has coursed through her, the world she has recorded merely by living."  4.5⭐️  Only a writer as incredible as Ernaux could get me to not only read but devour essentially a timeline of war, politics and technology in (mostly) France between 1940 and 2000. Her starting each new year with the imagery of a personal dated photograph or video is divine. She creates an impersonal retelling that is solely based on her own memories which is too good to pass up.  Can't wait to read more Ernaux this year.","chloe"

"What a remarkable book! Easily one of the best books I have read in recent years.  It is a memoir, but detached and unsentimental. The author talks about her own life, perhaps slightly fictionalized, but it is not really about the details of her life. She is using her life as a mirror of the world she lived in -- mostly France, but also the whole world. It starts in 1941 and ends in 2006.  She picks up little artifacts of memory -- a photograph, a film, a song -- and she talks about the life of a girl, a young woman, a middle-aged person, and finally, someone in her sixties, all through referring to herself in the third person.  The focus is never on the details of her personal life but on how the world around her was changing and the marks it left on her own thinking and her attitudes and values. It reminds us of the illusion that we live one continuous life with the same "me" when we are the amalgamation of many selves, smoothly dovetailing into each other where the transitions become impossible to see anymore.  She was born 14 years before me in a country that is so very different from my home. Yet, we shared similar shifts in history and attitude at different ages. She talks of the 1968 Paris revolts when she was in her late twenties, convinced the world was about to change. At the same time, Calcutta was going through similar unrest. We also heard of Paris, but did they hear of Calcutta? I was fifteen, and we, too, believed that the world was about to change.  The possibility of revolutionary change fizzled away, but not completely. We both saw changes in our local governments, and there was hope. Slowly, we were disillusioned. Our personal focus shifted, but the regrets remained. Again and again, the world events that affected and changed her also changed me and us. That is where the book resonates so well across cultures. The story of humanity is often tied together with the same strings. The book ends before the recent pandemic, but that has been the most unifying experience in human history. Even the two world wars did not touch the entire planet, but this one did.  The book will resonate with people many years from now because the nature of psychological, political, and moral time will remain relatable and universal.    ","Kunal Sen"
"The "writing project" Annie Ernaux mentions sometimes in this book turns out to be this book! Her objective was "by retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory (to) capture the lived dimension of History." And that's pretty much what she accomplishes in these pages. She makes the particular become universal (for her generation in France) by using the pronoun "we" instead of "I" (sometimes "she") in telling the memoir of her life in memories lived from 1941 into the 21st century.  Her book begins with memories of the French Occupation and WWII, even WWI, because of instilled memories heard in conversations with her parents and grandparents. As she grows up into teen years and adulthood, the current politics, government, wars, social trends of France affect her generation directly.  Sections of the book are introduced with descriptions of still black and white photos depicting the author and others (friends, husband, children) as "the years" speed by. Looking back, the author is awed by how quickly the past events and stages of life have passed. The future becomes a "matter of urgency" as she determines to write and finish her book.  I enjoyed most the personal accounts of her feelings, thoughts, viewpoints, at various stages of life, as her generation parallels mine. In America, I also felt the constraints on personal freedoms of the 60s, lived through "women's lib," embraced the freedoms of new values and transformation through college education, and in recent years, the advent of new, mystifying technology. Even as a married woman, the author is still reviewing, considering her identity and her place in the world.  There are too many turnovers of French regimes, some of which were met with favor by the author and other left-leaning friends of her generation. As soon as one favorable government is installed, it's over and replaced by a more stringent, less free and "light" government. I rushed past most of the mentions of French politics but was interested in the author's take on American politics and culture. Her colleagues were momentarily deeply afflicted by the horror of the 2011 attack on the World Trade Center. The New Year fearmongering of the arrival of the 21st century is felt by the French, and there are mentions of the Viet Nam war, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and many other events common to our national histories.  The translation is well done, except there are many French phrases, titles, and sayings not translated into English. I found this annoying. In addition, I wish that if the photographs described in the book actually exist, that they could have been shown. The black and white photographs on the book jacket are dramatic and express much of the angst expressed beautifully in this unusual memoir.","Jean"

"3.5/5. i can absolutely understand the popularity of this book, however personally i simply did not enjoy it to such a level. i felt this is an excellent showcase of the literary talent that ernaux possesses, as she writes with the blend of nostalgia and astute observation that such a work demands, including some well-placed wit. the aspect i enjoyed most was the interspersed moments of more personal introspection in which ernaux positions herself against the background of the world that she is so fondly describing. the discussion of the changing female experience was very insightful, and i appreciated the discussions on how difficult and exasperating it can be attempting to express your unique inner life when desperate to do so. the fond reminisces of family life which led into the discussions that we after all are one of billions across our world were very heart-warming, too.","Jude Burrows"
"A tale of both individual and collective memory, Annie Ernaux’s "The Years" paints a vivid picture of the author’s internal and external life, from her early childhood in the 40s to her late adult life at the beginning of the new century, while also making a profoundly poetic analysis of what it means to exist as a human. Fragments of personal life are mixed with a recounting of political events, pop culture and instants of the world shifting and changing through the inevitable course of time. The specific references to France in that specific time frame could have been overwhelmingly strange (to a Portuguese Millennial), if not that familiarity of the patterns that repeat themselves through time and space. We all have our own references, and it almost gets blurry, this sensation that people live the same life, in different ways, or maybe different lives, in the same way. Our different personal lives, in the end, represent our shared existence. One that is seen and felt in culture, livelihoods… humanness, really. The way in which the author uses “she” to tell her own biography, almost distancing herself from the story of her life, while using “we” to describe world events, as if the voice of an entire generation, further reinforces this notion that our individual lives are somehow collective in nature. A completely well deserved Nobel Prize to the author, who's writing made me believe that life has meaning. There is an indescribable beauty in a sentence that reminds you of something that is not easy to place. I got emotional many times, simply because of the beauty of words.","EVA"

"I think I admired this more than I loved it - I'm comparing it to some of her more intimate and personal books like A Man's Place, which absolutely floored me. I was impressed by this as a technical feat but I don't think I'd read it again.  I found her use of the collective pronoun really interesting (I read the English translation so this was 'we') - particularly when she's talking about immigrants, Muslims and racism. She's obviously walking a bit of a tightrope of speaking on behalf of the French nation/a typical Parisian intellectual woman of her class and also perhaps about her personal feelings - maybe she does truly find Muslims and black people kind of barbaric? We're never quite sure. That's why her mix of social history and autobiography is so fascinating and savage.","Sara Ahmad"
"This is an important book. Not always easy to read, in that the subject matter can at times be disturbing.

"On a New Yorker Fiction podcast episode in which a story by Annie Ernaux was the focus, the guest was asked what made her read Ernaux “so voraciously”, and she said: “There was something startling about the prose. The language is incredibly direct and simple in a kind of shocking way. I had never seen prose quite that declarative in literary form.”  That declarative, direct style is what you get in The Years as well, in which Ernaux sort of carved out a new form/genre. I can’t say for sure whether it is completely original, but that’s how’s it been described, and I for sure haven’t read anything like it. It is a “collective biography.” The best description would be her own words, as she wrote about it in the book:  “All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History.”  “She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days…”  The Years goes from 1964 to 2006, and charts changes in the atmosphere, sensations, lifestyles, sentiments and values of French society. It moves fluidly between big world events, and small personal moments. It marks the passage of time in a disturbing way, and considers the strange workings of memory.  Ernaux’s forthright manner, authority and intelligence made this cultural study a fantastic, fascinating read. And a new kind of read, for me.","Baz"

I read it compulsively, over 24 hours that felt like years, when I was eating, while I sat in the university waiting for my class to arrive, late into the night.

"All the images will disappear:  the jangling of your mother’s keys in the driveway before she enters, somehow audible from every room in the house. The tone is unique and particular to her  leaving the British Film Institute after watching David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive for the first time and tasting the cold darkness of Southbank in December. It was light when you entered. As you cross the bridge towards Westminster, snow falls, generally  not being old enough to remember, but being told where and what you were doing on September 11 2001  the silhouette of your friends dancing, intertwining, behind frosted glass on the back door at your university house. Outside the garden walls a pandemic spread via physical contact rages on. Kiss Me by Sixpence None The Richer is playing. You’re alone. You’re drunk. You’re smiling  seeing a dead body for the first time; that day-boat trip in Greece. Six years and some months old. The old man’s heart stopping halfway up the incline as you watch from the boat far below, bobbing on the water. His face covered in red from where he subsequently drops and cracks his skull on a perfect rock. Your father and a Greek stranger help his limp body down the hill as your mother holds you on her lap, trying her best to distract you  the liberation of exiting an exam hall and knowing you have completely and utterly failed  your first real date at sixteen years old. Taking a girl to an Italian restaurant. You don’t like each other, you kiss anyway, you fly home with your pulse pounding hot in your neck  hearing Radiohead’s Fake Plastic Trees for the first time, and  saturday morning advertisements in between cartoons. Your brother chews coco pops loudly near you. The jingle for Lelli Kelly shoes will be stuck in your head for decades: We’re Lelli Kelly, the cutest shoes, oh yeah. We’re Lelli Kelly we are so cool, oh yeah  the taste of sour cream and onion Pringles becoming inextricably linked with Boxing Day spent with family on your father’s side. On eating one crisp suddenly you’re sitting on a fibrous carpet and outside there’s a small ornamental garden  eating the best tacos of your life, purchased in cash from a shack on the promenade at Broadstairs beach. It’s the height of one British summer and you’re there with a girlfriend. The sun makes your head pound - you’re overwhelmed and you peel yourself off of the sand and wade into the water  your grandma’s best friend being stripped of body weight and dignity as he is ravaged by cancer. You cannot bring yourself to see him. As you stand alone in the corridor in his ward you realise that this is the first time you’ve cried without giving permission for it to happen  one summer evening a friend sticks his head through a narrow gap in a fence at a park. There’s a big group of you and it’s late but not remotely dark. He cannot remove his head and you laugh so hard your abdominals still ache the next morning  ——————-  I write this simply as I found the opening not only inspiring but quite fun to replicate. The Years works best when it’s being a sort of abstract mirror, giving insight into a specific yet relatable experience (I find, sometimes, the more specific something is, the more applicable it can be in a general sense, strangely) - and I think she knows this, hence the format being completely devoid of “I”, which is of course unusual for a memoir. Detail is stated almost factually, as if we were already to know, which is awesome. Reading results in reflection!  I’m surprised this is considered as groundbreaking as it is. It seems to me to be a very enjoyable and healthy way of going about a piece like this. I’m surprised it hasn’t been done more, or at least I’m not aware of it if so. Speaking of, I did really quite enjoy how meta she becomes at the end, talking about this very same question of form.  She’s a great writer. Some incredible lines in here. There are also some quite nothingy sections which did little for me.  Miss Ernaux you can’t talk about how bad a lot of aspects of the past were and then talk about how bad the modern day is in relation to what you’ve already described! You can’t have it both ways! (But maybe that’s also her point).  3.5/5","Rory Jones"

Our memory didn't have time to associate them with moments of existence"), but Annie Ernaux is not my kind of memoirist. On almost every page I was awed by Ernaux's voice and observations, but this book is often painfully quotidian (and not in a blissful Didion way). The Years sometimes read like a personal schedule or to-do list, and for that reason possibly could have been a private diary/journal.","Sarah Dunwoodie"

"This was a narrative that fully captivated and resounded with me on so many levels. While living some 19,000 kms from the authors home city in Paris her memories resonated with me so strongly and captured so many of those I have experienced myself in my 70+ years of life in New Zealand. Our lives while coloured and infused with our local culture in some dimensions are yet so universal and similar on others. We have shared the same global influences and felt similar emotional reactions and impacts from those world wide events that shook and rattled us all. But as well the smaller domestic and familial family dynamics that Ernaux so well expresses and celebrates or berates, she touches the core of our own lives in so many ways with masterful strokes of the pen. The world she has shared through her own life is given with such honesty, reflective optimism but also with an unflinching awareness of her flaws and vulnerability as increasing age presents itself in its many ways. This is a book that I would value owning and reading again only to further offer a grounding and reflective discourse of a life well lived and loved.","Derek Macleod"

"A very beloved friend gave me The Years (en anglais) and then we decided to try and read it in the original French ... which turned out to be exceptionally difficult because the prose and the narrative are so fragmented. Then I read it in English, and honestly ... I don't love memoir, and I found this one to be very fragmented and sometimes kind of distasteful. There was a lot of self consciousness, a lot of masturbation and menstruation, and then an odd moment after the terror attacks of 9/11 when she insults the US president and then scorns a periodical that says, "We are all Americans," and she basically says not only, "Im not!" but also blames the US for betraying the trust of all the French people by not being invincible and not being able to foil an attack where the only weapons used were simple boxcutters. Im not THAT super rah rah Team America but I found that kind of distasteful —enough that I felt it excused me from having to finish the last 15 pages of the book. However, this is a Nobel Prize winner and a work by a woman considered one of the best of all the modern French writers, so obviously there is more to this book than I was able to take from it.","Cynthia"

""The future is too immense for her to imagine. It will happen, that's all."  When I first started reading this book two years ago, I couldn't get through the first chapter. The way Ernaux captures snippets from the past was subtle, yet devastating. It felt like going through her memory box, a collection of newspaper clippings, songs, feelings, and photos blurring the lines between past and present. The bittersweetness of memory, the evanescence of youth, and how we spend our lives too quickly was too much for me at the time. I set the book aside.  Reading this book now makes me reflect on how I want to live but more importantly how I want to remember it, especially in a world where digital technologies dominate. Ernaux's own sentiment is that "with digital technology, we drain reality dry". How we save something from a time we will never be again is so closely tied to the medium that we capture that time with. Will I only remember my middle school days in the world of Instagram posts? Spotify playlists? What will I remember from my >100k photos stored, but unopened, sitting in my drive? In the fervor of capturing the perfect moment, taking hundreds of photos where the most important aspect is the taking of the photos, each photo's value is cheapened. What do we lose in this process? Will I truly be able to recall the feelings and sensations of the time that I have lived?  By finally finishing "The Years" for my 23rd bday, I gave myself the best bday gift I could ever ask for: an existential crisis.","momoka"

"“She will capture the lived dimension of history.”  I am left astounded at Annie Ernaux’s “The Years.” So much so that I struggle to find words to begin thinking about this kind of autobiography, if one were to call it that, or as she calls it, a “collective memory in an individual memory”, an attempt to skim the words off “the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope.”  I felt as though Ernaux were attempting to make a Proustian attempt at a written personal history, one that becomes an “instrument of struggle” to “capture the light that suffuses faces no longer seen and tables groaning with vanished food.” Unlike Proust, Ernaux performs this struggle with a collective in mind, as though all of France were reminiscing on the lost years, the years spanning from 1941 to 2006.  Details of everyday life, table conversations on politics and gossip, the genealogies of morality, the eternal transformation of juvenescence, reflections of life as a women in the progressions and regressions of western society, technological advances and the concomitant losses on the soul, patterns of war and strife—all of this and more are stationed as signposts through the constant passing of The Years. The loss of God, pupils carving into desks “God exists I stepped in it”, the sense of meaning post-1968 in Paris, the sense of play, the inception of globalized time, Auschwitz, September 11, Nintendo, the discourses of pleasure and shame, and the disappearance of all images. With all of these memories and their fading facial features, the only thing left to do is to write a story, in a culture with no patience for stories, a story of love, “a story of the time-before.”","Braden Matthew"

"This is an autobiography unlike any other. There are many wonderful and enjoyable inventions. I am sure I did not uncover all of them, but I did was fantastic. The book requires some work, but the rewards are more than plenty.  Most biographies are about the protagonist traveling through time and age, but this gives the impression of the protagonist standing till, and time and history flowing in front of them. You get to see how Annie recollects her life in her mind, not Annie sharing carefully selected scenes to form a story in her head. This biography is not a story as it occurred, but as it is remembered. Everything is presented as something recollected from memory - and they bring all the million variations we simply term our ‘memories’.  And memories - fleeting images, images invoking memories, memories of others captured in our memories of them, moments, memories captured through events, incidents, feelings, history, collective memories, disagreements in collective memories, memories of pain, memories of pleasures, culture and everyday activities transmitted over generations as memories, memories of our thinking, memories of our looks, memories of our thinking of our looks. And many more. There is a temptation to get a marker that can catalog all these nuances of memory that Annie weaves through the book.  Since I do have a bias for books that deal with memory well (Austerlitz by W.G. Sebald, War and Turpentine by Stefan Hertmans, and The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes are some I remember enjoying), this book was a treat. And I suspect that Proust had some influence on this book, whereas Proust (and his madeline) had a different intensity in its treatment, this one takes a different tack toward memories.  You can see the changes in the context, depth, and vividness of memories that vary over time, and they become clearer as they come close to the present. Still, yet as she grows older, she sees that she ironically spends time on the memories of the distant past, sort of like the ‘Rosebud’ from Citizen Kane. And she imagines how this wonderful thing, our memories, may disintegrate, become unreliable and fade away.  There are no chapters, just as life is when it is flowing. Each ‘scene’ runs a page or a few and is either written in the first person (she uses ‘we’ instead of ‘I’ - she explains that ‘we’ is more suitable for this impersonal biography), second person, or just the scene is being described. Annie doesn’t talk about her work or any specifics but the book is filled with events and incidents - politics, art, pop culture, electronics, etc. She explains later that those events helped ground her memories in time and helped her write the book. Everyone else around Annie is a blur - the only one who has been in any shape or form is her mother. Yet, you can see Annie as an intellectual who still does the family thing, and unabashedly wants physical love, though you get a sense of wariness.  As you come to the end, the flow of the book and the author's thinking and writing merge - plainly and clearly - and this was helpful for me to confirm what I thought this book was about and help me understand more. Since the author has shared her view of the book and I felt it is useful, allow me to share a few of those fragments below.  “What matters to her, on the contrary, is to seize this time that comprises her life on Earth at a given period, the time that has coursed through her, the world she has recorded merely by living. “ “The tiny moment of the past grows and opens onto a horizon, at once mobile and uniform in tone, of one or several years. Then, in a state of profound, almost dazzling satisfaction, she finds something that the image from personal memory doesn't give her on its own: a kind of vast collective sensation that takes her consciousness, her entire being, into itself. “ “So her book's form can only emerge from her complete immersion in the images from her memory in order to identify, with relative certainty, the specific signs of the times, the years to which the images belong, gradually linking them to others; to try to hear the words people spoke, what they said about events and things, skim it off the mass of floating speech, that hubbub that tirelessly ferries the wordings and rewordings of what we are and what we must be, think, believe, fear, and hope. All that the world has impressed upon her and her contemporaries she will use to reconstitute a common time, the one that made its way through the years of the distant past and glided all the way to the present. By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History. This will not be a work of remembrance in the usual sense, aimed at putting a life into story, creating an explanation of self. She will go within herself only to retrieve the world, the memory and imagination of its bygone days, grasp the changes in ideas, beliefs, and sensibility, the transformation of people and the subject that she has seen…” ","Rajesh Kandaswamy"
"I understand why this book is so lauded and it is technically impressive, well written and really does seem to capture the lens of France at this point in time (although if she'd missed the mark, I wouldn't know). But... there's absolutely no plot and most of it is kind of dull. At times I would get swept along by the prose and artistry of the writing but on the whole it wasn't exactly an enjoyable reading experience but just mostly a slog. I may unfortunately just not be the right audience for this.","Nat"

"We abandoned Corneille and Boileau for Boris Vian, Ionesco, the songs of Boby Lapointe and Colette Magny, Pilote magazine and comic books.  This is a strangely repellent book: cynical, cold, detached, remote. An unflowing succession of objective observations. There is very little self-love here: the author does not encourage us to admire or like the people of her time. And for large parts of the first half (confession: I didn't finish it once I realised I was starting to skip passages) it is largely meaningless if you were not alive in France of the 1950s to 70s.  Far too much of the book is obsessed with specifically French culture and politics, as the quote above illustrates. If the names D'Estaing, Chirac, Sarkozy, Mitterand, De Gaulle et al carry particular resonance for you, then perhaps you'll enjoy this book. But it would be rather like a French person caring enough to read about Eden, Macmillan, Wilson, Heath and Callaghan.  The later parts become more familiar to many of us, but frankly do we want to read another person's reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror, or a continued succession of French brand names and cultural references?

"“The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs.”  This book is an interesting and ambitious literary project. The work here is to step outside the self and watch time, witnessing its passage as chronicler, observing the changes, its ebb and flow, as they say, removed and at the same time immersed as a character in the society these observations are made in. It begins in post-world war two France, French society still reeling from its devastations and not confronting the horrors that emerged from it.  The voices in this book oscillate between the writer, described throughout in the third person singular “she”, representative of Ernaux, and the first person plural “we”, representative of her generation. It traces the development of a society in six decades, each chapter opening with the description of an image of the voice driving the narrative (pictures and film) in her various ages, childhood to old age, and further description of those around her and their surroundings that form the different settings, the social structures, the norms and histories, the social, political, and economic happenings, the technological advancements (television, digital camera, internet, etc.) and the ways life is affected by them, social progress and setbacks, and international news. It is quite the project; I personally can’t imagine how obsessive one might get in terms of what to place and what not to place—a review like this one alone makes me jittery for days, and so I was very surprised that this book had less than 260 pages.  Raised in a working class family, which is a source of embarrassment for the voice, the writer and the world she’s aware of is, at first, conservative. The Algerian war looms in the background, discrimination of Arabs and other minorities is accepted as norm and, of course, not even viewed as discrimination, and France has absolute right as a colonial power, “No one knew how the troubles there had started, but they all agreed, as did we, who’d studied it for the brevet exam, that Algeria, with its three départements, was French, like much of Africa, where our territories covered half the continent in the atlas.”  Over the course of the years, as ideas and ideologies sprout and bud, changes on the societal and political levels are made. Progress is realized, decolonization (as physical withdrawal from territories) begins, women’s rights are expanded, people have more money to spend and consumerism takes a tight hold, this generation always awaits the final revolution that would settle all inequalities for once and for all, which never comes. Meanwhile still bearing witness to the wars, plagues, progress achieved, progress eroded, violence, and personal changes in a life.  It is difficult, impossible even, perhaps, due to the elusive nature of time and memory, to capture precisely the years in their perfect entirety. The snatches of memory as well as information that later emerges, after time works on it as it does everything else, as historical fact (open to dispute, manipulation, and denial, of course) that comprise this book makes it feel, for a lack of better word, thin. It reads in parts as a montage of occurred events. The community that the writer brilliantly paints in childhood is never replicated in the various other communities she finds herself in after she grows and leaves her town, which, granted, would require more volume, and such effrontery to make such demands on my part too. Yet this book remains a remarkable achievement, and I think that the deficit is inescapable, and perhaps even that is a testament of what becomes of the years, the salvaged biographical and historical information intertwined, as representation of a life in this way.  In the ending of Swann’s Way by Proust, who is referenced multiple times in this book, the narrator in a moment of disenchantment remarks: “The places we have known do not belong only to the world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. They were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; the memory of a particular image is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.” And Ernaux’s The Years wonderfully encapsulates this.

Thought it was a memoir but it’s more of an anthropological look at generational shifts, women’s rights, politics, sexual health, consumerism, technology, etc. you name it and forces you to reflect on the relationship between aging and identity and memory.

"“She would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?” Annie Ernaux ~ The Years (Les Années)  Let the great world spin.  A woman in search of lost time, decides to write a book about how she understands her own place in the timeline of (her) life.  But it’s a memoir turned on its head, spun in a radically different way. A memoir recounted solely from the outside, collecting images, names, places, idioms and expressions, historical moments, family events, societal shifts and dated photographs in the mad rush of remembering.  A memoir as an existential spool of yarn, propelled by the warning of its bewitching first line: “All the images will disappear”.  A memoir where the elegant distanced “she” and the buzzy collective “we” replace the too egotistical “I” in a dizzying artistic project, adding layer upon layer upon layer of meaning on one single little person.  A memoir as palimpsest, where the evolution of the self is observed in the never-ending halls of mirrors of History, in the never-ending Sunday family lunches where the stories we tell literally speak what becomes memory.  A memoir that asks - in a sea of years and a handful of photographs that feel both blurry and delineated - the haunting, daunting question: Where are you in the dizzying dance of your life?","Melanie"

"I've lately had a bad streak with the books I've had to read for uni. I've found them, for the most part, quite boring and uninteresting. but then, THEN, I read this masterpiece, and I regained my faith in my creative writing degree.  because, omg this book is one of the best things i've read in a very long time. I would describe this book as a jigsaw puzzle of History (the main historical events of 1940-2008) and history (Ernaux's life), where each piece is delicately crafted to create a collective narrative of life in this time period.  I loved the way the two pieces (personal & historical) melded together. the differentiation in pronouns from "we" to "she" worked wonders. the former created a collective history that was more impactful than most other historical accounts and the latter allowed her to tell an autobiographical narrative in a revealing and impactful way.  i loved this book so much!!","iris"
"I really didn’t like this book. And I would not have finished it except that it’s the selection for my book club. Frequently, strong opinions make for good discussions though, and that’s what I’m hoping for. The author is trying to write an autobiography of her generation, I suppose. It comes off as pedantic and ridiculously bourgeois and downright snooty to this American reader. I watched several interviews with Ernaux and in person she is earnest and somewhat appealing. I think you might need to be French or at least know more about French culture of the past 80 years to appreciate what she has put together here. For me, it seemed like a longer prose version of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire” from a French point of view.","Toni"
"An autobiography, sort of, told in the first person plural. Though not quite as literally as in Then We Came to the End: rather, as the narrator puts it There is no "I" in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only "one" and "we," as if now it were her turn to tell the story of the time-before. She (the author/character) refers to herself as a figure in a series of photos (described but not shown), but also as a member of and stand-in for a generation. In this book life is described in a series of images, the more poignant for their triviality. Commercial jingles, childhood games, the feeling of a certain kind of fabric. It has echoes of Sebald, but even more so Joe Brainard's I Remember (which Ernaux's compatriot Perec copied as Je me souviens, which actually gets name checked at the end of the book) And inside ourselves, we had a great, vague memory of the world. Of almost everything we retained little beyond a word, detail, or name that would later make us say, like Georges Perec, "I remember," whether it concerned Baron Empain’s kidnapping, Picorette candies, Bérégovoy’s socks, Devaquet, the Falklands War, or the Benco breakfast. But these were not real memories. That was the name we gave them, but in fact they were something quite different: time markers. And of course, since this is Ernaux, there is a lot of sex, very matter-of-factly and without shame. From the repressed hormonal teenage years under a strict Catholic school's rules, the book follows the hero through the slow liberalisation of the 60s (including an illegal abortion) to the wild experimentation of the 70s to her divorce in the 80s and subsequent string of younger lovers (alluding to the much younger, married Russian with whom she had the torrid affair detailed in Simple Passion).  Another maybe representative quote: And so she will never forget the date of the insurrection in Algeria, nor that All Saints’ afternoon, of which she will retain one clear image, a kind of pure fact: a young woman squatting over the grass, as if to lay an egg, [micturating], and standing again, pushing her skirts down. To this storehouse of illegitimate memory she consigns things too unthinkable, shameful, or crazy to put into words — a brown stain on a sheet of her mother’s that had once belonged to her grandmother, dead for three years — an indelible spot that violently attracts and repels her, as if it were alive — the scene between her parents on the Sunday before her sixth-grade entrance exam, when her father tried to kill her mother, dragging her to the cellar next to the block where they kept the sickle planted I thought that the second half/third of the book was much weaker, descending as it does into a listing of political news, with the cursory hurrahs for the good guys (the FLN, IRA, PLO, trade unionists, immigrants, Allende, Mitterand) and boos for the bad (the United States, austerity, police and soldiers, Pinochet, Chirac). Ernaux is a bit older than the soixante-huitards but supported them from the sidelines as a young mother. "France was asleep" and the shake-up was inevitable, but it died out into nothing. But what exact change would Ernaux want? Of course this isn't a book about politics, but I was frustrated by the hero's bourgeois rebellion, passively supporting every revolutionary while content to enjoy all the bland conveniences of modern life. She possesses the exasperating disdain for facts of the European intellectual, who can hand-wave the Khmer Rouge as just one of those sad and inexplicable parts of life, but point to long lines during Christmas shopping as the way that capitalism seeks to humiliate and dehumanize the individual.  Somewhat related, the reason for her character's divorce is never explained, except for a vague gesture at the freedom enjoyed by women growing up in the liberated 1980s. Did it make her happier? It is hard to tell, and just asking the question feels absurd. A thick cloud of anomie and ironic detachment surrounds the author, impregnable to people like me who think you should try to figure out if your life is objectively all that bad, and if so take steps to change it!","Josh Friedlander"
"Sobering and somehow urgent, despite it's disaffected, clinical narrator. left me thinking about the slow march of time towards death, a collapsing of memory, the futility of trying to remember most of life. but then, there is some small hope at the end, that one can at least memorialize some individual history in writing...","Jasmine Sachar"
"My second by Annie Ernaux, a lifelong account of her experiences spoken in the collective sense, as though they were events that happened to everybody (in many cases, they were). Perceptive, poetic, and honest in a way that is not so much apologetic as it is beyond the need for apologies. The way this book deals with outdated ideas, with societal racism, prejudices, that sort of thing, is totally matter-of-fact - Ernaux has no interest in passing judgment, only in recalling the way that things were and how people felt about them at the time. It can feel antithetical to so many contemporary books that feel deathly afraid of anything traumatic or controversial, either preferring to avoid them altogether, immediately apologize for it, or to have some sort of narrator or self-insert character ironically acknowledge them. Ernaux's observations simply feel candid, an honest reflection on the middle-class intellectual and their evolution from the child of parents who lived through WW2 through different governmental regimes, political movements, decades of consumer products, advertising slogans, pop songs, television shows, films, and celebrities. I wasn't sure if I would make this my book club book and I don't think I will, but I greatly enjoyed it.","Will McGee"
"this was a devastating read, from her comments on first times and reproductive fears to her disconnect with younger generations and the fast-paced world advancing around her; i became overwhelmed with the fear of forgetting all my experiences. it made me thankful for all of the journals i've kept documenting my life since i was 12 and for the close relationship i have with my mother who never made me feel bad or guilty for how i've lived my life.","Romy"
"(I listened to the audiobook)  With it's self-referencing about "she [who is] writing", it's expression of a "lived history" with a certain political bent, it's no wonder that Annie Ernaux won the Nobel Prize in Literature (especially if this is her Magnum Opus).  With it's reoccurring theme of sexual freedom and idealized realism, it's definitely a French book.","Christian"

""1968 was the first year of the world."  Wonderful. Amazing style of telling a story, teaching the history. Amazing autobiography without using any "I". As a big fan of autobiographies I felt like all I read till this book were wrong. That should be the exact style of autobiography writing. She redefined this genre.  I felt like I was there every time. I was in every family meeting, in university, in streets of 1968 Paris. I surprised how technology changes with her. I confused about my thougts when she critized hers. I was encouraged when she talked about a strike or protest every time.   The simple, soft tone of explaining very long life admired me. Thanks for this masterpiece, I think I will read this book for many times in my life, future.","Toghrul Maliki"
"The abundance of French culture and history references forced me to skim a lot, but I truly loved this book. It was a meditation on memory and remembrance and I was left feeling very hopeful about the world and our collective future. I also absolutely loved the format of starting a section with a personal photo/video, then broadening out the descriptions to everything that’s going on around the photo/video, including in international affairs. This book was a good reminder that people’s views are allowed to change throughout their lifetimes and sometimes it takes decades for truths to be revealed. We don’t always have all the answers.

"Annie has given me a new angst, the struggle to coexist with so many memories. For mere survival, we spend our lives trying to arrange and understand the past experiences that have shaped us, and Annie has found her way by writing "The Years".  Reading "The Years" implies accepting a responsibility: to become an heir to Annie's memories. Like Marcel Proust, she spends the whole book writing about a book she would like to write, until she ends up writing a whole book.  I am fascinated by how she manages to write from a collective self. From this self and historical portrait, she describes (among other things) the slow but despairing conquest of capitalism in our societies. How it breaks into our daily lives with the promise of freedom, only to destroy our patience to create stories.  Perhaps that is why, after prolonging the writing of this book for more than twenty years, Annie finds herself urged to start writing it, just before it is too late to preserve her memories.  And it is beautiful that, despite the sixty-decade gap between me and Annie, her narrative about her past resonates with the way I have always narrated mine.","Nicole"

"It's a memoir, but more importantly, it is a memoir not just of an individual, but of a generation. Ernaux writes of the years between 1940 and 2007, attempting to "capture the reflection that collective history projects upon the screen of individual memory". She writes it in the voice of a generation - 'we', and describes herself in the third person - 'she'. And while we learn of her life - her childhood in the provinces, university, an illegal abortion, marriage, children, career, divorce, independence, writing, we also learn of a generation growing up post war, when war and death and the Church still loomed over the collective consciousness, when sex was taboo, a society of scarcity. Each subsequent decade comes with its individual and collective memory - university and the move away from home, clandestine sex, illegal abortions, Simone de Beauvoir,  the Algerian war, the Cuban Missile crisis, the Vietnam war. And then marriage, and babies, and career, and supermarkets and domestic bliss but also Mitterrand and the vague feeling of having deviated from former goals, May '68 and revolution, the sexual revolution, women's lib, divorce, the walkman, consumerism. Soon enough there is Solzhenitsyn and the Gulags and the confusion of a generation bred on the dream of socialism, AIDS, waves of immigration, Le Pen. Suddenly revolution is a bad word, capitalism rules, the 'end of history' is proclaimed, Russia is nothing, there is Saddam Hussein and war again, and you are getting old, your children are all about the latest technology, sex has lost its ability to surprise, and the US is the power everyone looks up to,  And so on and so forth until 2007, when she is officially retired and living an older woman's life. It is an education in French history through the second half of the 20th century, but it is also world history, so much of the twentieth century is 'globalised'.   It is an amazing way to write a memoir, and Ernaux holds me in her thrall through two hundred pages of taut prose, part sociology, part history, part memoir. It's Ernaux's attempt to 'save something from the time where we will never be again' and it truly is a wonderful attempt. I loved it.","Parvathy"
"I wish I was able to capture the essence of time, my time, as well (and beautifully) as Ernaux. Captivating story of the author, her generation, and her country. Between grand moments and little details. Fascinating ode to memory and self reflection. Both so important for me. Because of all those stories about people I never met or don’t remember, and which accompany me since I was little. And because of my own efforts to understand myself better, to know who I really was/am. «Sauver quelque chose du temps où l'on ne sera plus jamais.» Even if not for others, than for ourselves.","Gregorito"
"i like the poetiques of her work!!","Elena"
"an autobiographical novel that recounts the post-war history of France, together with its political and societal changes up till now - through a woman's eyes. also great to kinda balance out all the romances i've been reading lately lol","judith"
" Very much the literary equivalent of one of those "We Love The 1970s" shows but less fun -- "It was the three day week and power cuts, and there was a war in the Middle East. But Donny Osmond was on Top of the Pops and we all loved disco. We went to The Costa Del Sol where we read the latest sizzling Jackie Collins, but after Jaws we were afraid to go in the water...", intercut with a random woman making angel delight and worrying about aging.  Not nearly as entertaining as the memoir of an aspiring French leftist intellectual whose only names hobby is sex ought to be, and as amazingly humourless a book as I can recall reading. The coldness and joylessness are chilling.  We get a spin through French headlines from 1940-2008 or so, with a few odd inflections. The aspiring intellectual sees politics entirely in terms of individual politicians, and doesn't seem to have any set ideas about the world except the need to get shiny consumer goods, and to have as much sex as possible. The natural world doesn't seem to get a mention - no gardens, countryside, no spring or autumn. Having said their, her husband and children hardly get mentioned except as furniture.  The attempt to mix the view of white leftist middle class intellectual women (who I assume she speaks for ) with her own personal views jars repeatedly as she flips between what 'we' thought of Mitterand and 'our' job as a teacher. Oddly there is no sense of how the children or the teaching process change during her 40 years as a teacher, or whether she had any vocation.  It's a very dumbed-down view of history; the lack of any analysis is understandable given the setup, but it leaves the reader knowing little more than before. The most amazing thing I discovered was that homosexuality has been legal in France for 200 years and the age of consent is 15...but I only found this out from Google.  The narrator is a highly unsympathetic, self-centred character, who never seems to have any ideals she feels a need to act on. And her idea of writing is to write a book about, of course, herself.  Disappointing and unsatisfying. But short!","David Hambling"
"In recent years, I've encountered few books that rival the sheer brilliance of this one. It presents a semi-fictionalized biography of a French woman in her seventies, offering readers a unique vantage point into the dynamic and transformative landscape of the latter half of the 20th century. Through her lens, we witness a world in flux, richly depicted with vivid descriptions and meticulous attention to detail. The author's ability to weave together personal experiences with broader historical contexts is nothing short of masterful, making for an utterly delightful reading experience.","Juan Segundo"
"If I could read this in French, or had more knowledge of French history, this would be a 5 star book.","Kade"
"3.33 stars. Like a very bleak (with the most neutral connotation) clam-chowder.  Bottom line: no one writes like Annie Ernaux does. The Years is simultaneously the pinnacle of a niche narrative and a Polaroid of the universal-ish experience amidst the rise of consumerism—captured from a unique vantage point at the verge of personal and collective history.  So much grace.  ⏱️______________________✍🏼  “She has gone over to the other side but she cannot say of what … ‘I am a will and a desire.’ She does not say for what.”  “Real thoughts plumb the depths of transient sensations, impossible to communicate.”  “We remembered our parents’ reproach, ‘Be happy with what you've got!’ Now we knew that all we had didn't add up to happiness, but that was no reason to abandon things.”  “There were too many images for us to stop at each and recall the circumstances in which they were taken. Inside them, we lived a near weightless, transfigured existence. The signs of our existence multiplied and put an end to the sensation of time marching on.”  “We were mutating. We didn't know what our new shape would be.”  “By retrieving the memory of collective memory in an individual memory, she will capture the lived dimension of History … To hunt down sensations that are already there, as yet unnamed, such as the one that is making her write.”  “To save something from the time where we will never be again.”","Ziyan"
"A lot of the historical/French references went over my head, but still really enjoyed and great immersion into the French mindset.","Amanda Cleghorn"
" Recently I’ve been thinking of shifting baselines and how quickly certain things become normalized not just through but even within generations (like how my parents are just as addicted to their phones as I am). This is something Ernaux manages to capture so well - the slow shift in perceptions, opinions and attitudes throughout time, to the point where we forget things were ever different, or maybe we can’t remember because we hadn’t been born yet. Things become normalised and are deemed ‘necessary’ not because they’re necessarily right but because we’re made to feel as if things have always been this way; and because we don’t know any different we don’t question these things. The Years was a helpful reminder for me that things were once different and therefore can be different again.  Such a privilege to be able to step into a time before mine, a time that belonged to my parents and grandparents, a time that I’ve only ever experienced through images but never as immersive and tactile as Annie Ernaux manages to capture it through her unique way of writing. I’m sure this is a book I will return to throughout my life and different parts will resonate as I age and go through the stages of life as Ernaux did.:)","Nicky"
"I took a walk back in time with this lovely autobiographical history from WWII on. Being born in 1950, so much of this book was also in my memory. So many familiar events! Thoroughly enjoyed it.","Karen Monteith"
"Great book. Not one of my favorite by Ernaux, but amazing nonetheless. Contains her life story and cultural story somehow combined and separated at the same time. I love how Ernaux writes so rawly and doesn’t shy away from any hard truths.","Sid Lodge"
"I started this book twice. It was a little slow to get into, and at the beginning, there were a lot of historical references - French films, actresses, books - unfamiliar to me. As I got farther along, the scenes started to come together, blurry but accessible. Throughout the book there were not many specific scenes or incidents that touched me. But, on the last page, I finally understood that more than anything, this book is about time, and I cried.","Stephanie Tilden"
"This book I will read again, and I remembered/learned so much. I spent a joyful amount of time looking things up to make sure I had the history straight. I found myself reading faster once she got to the years where I've been alive...the translator's note is brilliant.  A few quotes I will think about:  "The profusion of things concealed the scarcity of ideas and the erosion of beliefs."  "The facts and reality, material and immaterial, were presented in numbers and percentages, of unemployed, of car and book sales, probabilities of cancer and death, "favorable" and "unfavorable" opinions. Fifty-five percent of French citizens think there are too many Arabs, thirty percent own a VCR, two million are unemployed. The figures added up to nothing but fate and determinism."  "She sees them as images of herself, taken apart and separated like matryochka dolls."  "We were increasingly irritated by the Americans' moral discourse, their shareholders, retirement funds, pollution of the planet, and loathing for our cheeses. To signify the fundamental poverty of their superiority, based on weapons and the economy, the word typically used to define them was "arrogance." They were conquerors with no ideals other than oil and the almighty dollar."","Alyson"
"Not my cup of tea, and I cannot recall how this landed on my read list…. Not a story, sort of non-fiction, this won lots of French writing awards, translated….vignettes about her life from 1941 - the 1970’s…. What is memory, what is history as we know it? Where doe these things come from? Are they truly remembered or passed on as such. Interesting, but again, not my type of reading..","Elizabeth Kane"
"Merci Garance pour la recommandation. C’était une très belle histoire.  Ernaux takes her readers through the decades, in an effortless weaving of the personal and political. It took me a while to get into, owing to my French, but once I did - wow. Her writing style is matter-of-fact, yet critical in every decade. There is pointed criticism of how we evolved into consumerism, capitalism, the vulnerability of our world. But she doesn’t get bogged down in the jargon — Ernaux is human, and tells the story of how we change both with and in relation to time. We are stories of a collective memory, both writing and being written upon.  It wasn’t necessarily the story but the writing style that made this special, deserving of 5 stars. I don’t think i’ve read a book that’s done it quite like this - that personal-political co-evolution.","Pree"
"A six star read, somewhere between Proust’s A La recherche du temps perdu, Virginia Woolf, Karl Ove Knausgaard and DFW’s Infinite Jest.  It is an impersonal memoir, almost devoid of emotion or personality, passive and unflinching. To use Ernaux’s own words “… a slippery narrative composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes, all the way to the final image of a life…”  It’s not going to be for everyone, but even in March I know this will be the book to beat for my 2024 Book of the Year.","Andy"
"“they will all vanish at the same time, like the millions of images that lay behind the foreheads of the grandparents, dead for half a century, and of the parents, also dead. images in which we appeared as a little girl in the midst of beings who died before we were born, just as in our own memories our small children are there next to our parents and schoolmates. and one day we’ll appear in our children’s memories, among their grandchildren and people not yet born. like sexual desire, memory never stops. it pairs the dead with the living, real with imaginary beings, dreams with history.”","nina okechukwu"
"Dazzling, captivating, sensationally good writing. Part memoir/part trauling through the 'years' that Ernaux and the women of her generation lived through. Ernaux has an amazing ability to combine collective history with personal experience, sweeping up everything from advertisements, political events and political expectations, social changes, memories, and memories of memories, to show how people are caught up individually and collectively in the march of time. She captures the profound and the seemingly trivial moments and events that make up people's inner and outer lives with mordant wit and philosophical depth. A triumph.","Matthew Carr"
"Ernaux's writing captures the time and space of a generation to represent its collective memory in an individual memory.","Jacob Joshy"
"Oh no, is this what the whole book is going to be like? was my ignoble first thought on this. Little did I know that this would conjure up my entire emotional palette and leave with me with a feeling of having understood my own on time on Earth better.     The Years is unlike anything else: a collective memoir of sorts, Ernaux tackles the task of retelling life in France from 1940 to 2006. Taking photos and videos as starters, she captures the feelings, topics and developments of entire generations.  The first few pages surprised me – no clear protagonist was introduced, no clear plot or narrative announced. I nearly regretted picking this up. And then it slowly unfolds, this story that is much bigger than the sum of its parts.  A rumination on the depth of time, the power of the past and the passing of ages. We start out in the 40s, a time which did a lot to deserve the label post-war era. Ernaux takes us back to when people were gathering hope for a better and more stable future, a future the narrative takes us to in time. It's a fascinating way in which history is presented to us: there are many little details – what people listened to, what they were watching and what they were preoccupied with and it's creating a vivid and sentimental window into the past. But there are no chapters, no breaks and so the narrative flows like time does: in a constant and reassuring stream that shows us how the one thing we can be certain of is change.  There are many cultural topics touched upon, but just as many personal. We've got two voices presented to us: there's the collective we that observes politics, the role of the woman, of sexuality, of individuality and consumerism and there's the very intimate she, that makes us follow a woman as she ages from child to elder woman. It's done in such a brilliantly intertwined way that we come to realise how deeply imbedded we are in the times we live in and how they change quicker than we are often able to realise. Once we were motivated students at riots, protesting for a better future and more rights, and before we know it we're the oldest and most somber person at annual family gatherings. This realisation touched me deeply, making me think about my own life and mortality quite a lot, while also giving me a new appeasement, a new gratefulness for the time I get to spend on this strange little planet.  Deeply moving and utterly true, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this and think of it as powerful stuff. I can't wait to read more of her work.","Michelle Curie"
"A beautifully written collective memoir.","Victoria Ward"
