"« Il n'y a point d'âge légal pour le malheur. » (There Is No legal age for misfortune).Indeed, Chateaubriand's life was almost romantic, tragic, terrible and fantastic. I see his memoirs like a confrontation between a dying old order (the aristocrats, the old French regime – Chateaubriand belongs to them) and a “new“order, modern, born of the Revolution. His memoirs cast another glance at the nineteenth-century birth. While Saint-Simon and then Auguste Comte are in the process of founding a religion of progress of mankind toward a future full of happiness; Chateaubriand sees this like an utopia and death through his testimony. A great reading. Far more enjoyable than Les Confessions of Rousseau.", Licinius
"Read - books 1, 6,7,8. It really is not my cup of tea, at all. It was so boring to me, and put me in a reading slump...", Valentine
"sad story but i like it the first part of these memoirs traversed by history, where the melancholy words hard to believe in the reality of the world, where the vanity of things always shines, is the most personal. Because the writer does not only tells them what he called his first career soldier and traveler, but the beginning of a life that is revealed to us as a story of training: the young Breton knight soon left for America and the aristocrat who fought in the army of the Princes, emigrated to England, before returning to France to become Chateaubriand.", Hicham
Another piece of cake. Took the time for reading it., Stef Onthesea
"Chateaubriand started his memoirs in 1803 at 35 years of age and wrote the last lines in 1841. He meant to remember his ideas and convictions rather than his personal life.  He did well; his life was exceptionally rich in historical events and his personal engagements important and outstanding.  A writer, a politician and a diplomat. A loyal aristocrat, at the French revolution of 1789. To save his head from the guillotine he had to flee to London. His elder brother did not take this precaution and was executed together with his wife.  In this first book of two, of this edition, his ‘Memoirs’ cover his life at a young age. From his birthplace Saint-Malo and then with his parents at Chateau Combourg.  As the second in line of birth, he had the traditional choice of going into religion or become a soldier. After a wrong start, he preferred becoming a soldier.  During the early years of the French Revolution, in 1791 he undertook a short voyage to America with a letter of recommendation and a meeting with George Washington.  He had the dream and illusion to be the first to discover the North-West passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. George Washington did not seem to have encouraged him. Young Chateaubriand had underestimated the distances, the terribly cold weather and the cost of hiring a ship and its crew.  Instead, he went ‘native,’ he had a romantic adventure with two indigenous girls who had taken a liking to him and followed around wherever he travelled. When the rightful family came to take the girls back, he did not fight. He was never a great fighter with the sword.  His arms were ink and feather an he became an extremely brave and respected soldier in this art of warfare.  After only five or six months in America, he embarked on a vessel to take him back to France. He had not gained much knowledge of George Washington, nor of America.  On his return to France, for financial reasons it seems, Chateaubriand was encouraged by his family to get married. In 1792 he was wed to Celeste Buisson de la Vigne.  Only on very rare occasions throughout his memories does Chateaubriand mention his wife. The reader can only guess of her whereabouts during her husband's extensive travels as well as an exile to London, his life as a soldier and travels to the Orient, etc. He seemed to have great respect if not love for her, and he praised her never failing loyalty.  On the other hand, Chateaubriand mentioned a good number of his lady-friends with whom it is unclear to which extent these relations were intellectual and platonic only.  In July 1792 he enrolled into a Royalist army and battles at Thionville, get wounded and discharged. Remarkable for me is the fact that aristocrats when fighting for the king, had to bring their own armament and provide for their daily substance. A fact which can explain the pillages and robberies of the population. For Chateaubriand, a poor aristocrat, it was a miserable experience.  Follows his exile to an uncle in Jersey and then to London. Lodging in an attic belonging to a cousin. Aristocrats had not learned how to make a living other than intellectually. Young Chateaubriand was soon starving and had troubles surviving a few months. Then he started works of translations and published an “Essai on Revolutions.”  1794 he learned of the death by guillotine of his brother and family.  1800 With a fake passport Chateaubriand returned to France and succeeded in publishing the first chapters of “Le Genie du Christianisme.”  It is by this work composed at a time when the revolution is persecuting religion that he became known and admired.  The years of Napoleon Bonaparte’s Empire. 1803 Chateaubriand after a meeting with Bonaparte is appointed Secretary to the French delegation in Rome. Later that year he is promoted by the First Consul to Chargé d’Affairs in The Valais.  1804 When he learns of the execution of the Duc d’Enghien, Chateaubriand resigns from his function of a minister. He expects to be arrested any time, but Bonaparte who has a surprising sympathy for Chateaubriand decides to ignore him.  Chateaubriand as a first-hand eyewitness includes an interesting biography of Bonaparte from his successful years of European Wars to the disastrous Russian invasion to the lost battle of Waterloo to his second and final downfall and exile to St. Helena.  Throughout his memories, Chateaubriand keeps a fair balance of admiration and contempt for Napoleon Bonaparte. According to him, Napoleon was the right man at the right time for France. France, following the revolution of 1789 had fallen into an endless reign of bloodshed, terror and anarchy. Napoleon established order, discipline and a legal frame, called ‘Code Napoleon’.  It was easy for him to enrol numberless and workless Frenchmen into an enormous army and with thousands of canons, he soon overrun all the European Kingdoms on victorious battles. All in a short few years, until he committed the error of attacking Russia over the great distances and terrible winter which was fatal to his glory and reign.  Chateaubriand’s admiration for Napoleon ended when he had crowned himself Emporer and started ruling as a despot, murdering or exiling every opponent, and censuring freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  Throughout the book, it became clear that Chateaubriand had become the champion of the freedom of the Press.  1806 Departure for his Voyage d’Orient and Jerusalem. These events, mentioned only in an abbreviated form in the memories, were published as a book under “L’Itineraire.”  This first book ends with two extremely important events in the History of France, the end of Bonaparte's Era of the Empire and the beginning of the Restoration of the Monarchy.  March 1814 at the final downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte, Chateaubriand publishes a brochure: “De Bonaparte et des Bourbons.”  Mai 1814 The Restoration of King Louis XVIII.  Chateaubriand is at the start of higher political status. He is named minister to Sweden then decorated with “Croix de St. Louis.” Then he is promoted to “Colonel de Cavalerie.”  But then he had a bad idea to publish “The Chart.” They were to be the laws of the aristocratic ruling as from this time. It brought him many admirers but also many enemies among his peers. “The King reigns, but does not govern”! Imagine the stun and awe at this statement at a time of a new Monarchy.  In consequence of this farsighted but untimely project, Chateaubriand was evicted as a minister, disgraced by King Louis XVIII and deprived of any income.  Chateaubriand’s political position was between a Constitutional Monarchy and the Republican Party.  As a loyal Aristocrat, forever faithful to the King, he could not be a leader of the Republicans.  And as a convinced Democrat in favour of a Constitutional Monarchy, he was suspicious and perceived as a danger to the King and therefore was in and out of favour according to whatever convictions he expressed. By consequence, the Chateaubriands were poor and rich over the years according to his political success of the time.  1821 Chateaubriand returns to favour. He is appointed Minister and is attaché to Berlin. Then he is appointed Member of the Private Council and Minister of State. He is decorated with the “Legion d’Honneur.” 1822 Chateaubriand is appointed Ambassador to London and is a celebrity among the Royalty and members of the Government. In September that year, he attends the Conges of Verone and has an important meeting with Czar Alexander and writes a separate book on this event. In December Chateaubriand is appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. 1824 June Chateaubriand is again evicted from his position as Minister. In September that year, King Louis XVIII dies, and his King Charles X is crowned King. 1825 Chateaubriand attends the crowning ceremony. 1828 Chateaubriand is appointed Ambassador to Rome.  In Mai that year he returns to Paris where he meets Mme. Recamier. He will continue meeting this lady throughout the rest of his life. It remains secret whether their relationship was purely intellectual. 1929 August. He resigned from his position of ambassador in Rome.  Revolution of 1830  King Charles X is forced to the abdication in favour of Louis Philipe, now Roy des Francais. Chateaubriand considered Louis Philipe as an imposter.  He remained loyal to the Bourbon family, The Duchess of Berry and her son Luis V, a child, whom Chateaubriand considers the legitimate King.  The Duchess of Berry was arrested and accused of preparing a coup d’etat and In this connection, Chateaubriand was also arrested but discharged innocent after two weeks.  Then in the following year on missions for The Duchess of Berry, Chateaubriand makes two long voyages to Prag (by coach, imagine!) where young Luis V in custody of Charles X, was brought up and educated.  Unfortunately, as the future did show, young Louis V was never to become the last Bourbon King.  Ultimately, our author’s implications in politics came to an end, and he returned to Paris to his final destination.  He died on 4th of July 1848.   To a French reader, the preeminent quality of Chateaubriand's work is the unique style of the early nineteenth romantic way of writing. Even today it is a reference for scholars and repeatedly referred to as the best French ever written.  Reading this book in depth is a work of slow progress. Chateaubriand did not follow a chronological order of progression. He went back and forth over the years of his travels, his successes of editions of literature and over his political careers.  Some unique aspects of this book are the detailed accounts of personal historical experiences, the assault of the Bastille by an infuriated crowd, his conversations with Bonaparte and King Luis XVIII as well as many other dignitaries at court and government assemblies. His memoirs take into account many original documents made available to him by Generals, Ministers, and many aristocratic families his close relations at the time.  Only an extremely gifted author of literary works as well as a politician and philosopher could provide the analytical insight that Chateaubriand was able to contribute.  It goes without saying that I recommend this unique work to my reader friends interested in French and European History at the time of the French Revolution and the years after.", Markus
