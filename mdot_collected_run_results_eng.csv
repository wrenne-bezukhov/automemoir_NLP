I read this book in French (because I'm french!). But I comment it in English, beacause I'd like you, English readers who would like to discover French state of mind from the late 18th and early 19th century and also the great History he really lived. It's not really fun, but it's Chateaubriand! So it's clever, pretentious (he could be!), historically very interesting and so many things more!",Gabrielle Dubois
Second half was really good too, focuses on Napoleon a lot, almost a mini biography of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Francois Chateaubriand was a cool guy. I like him. We would have been friends. We have a similar haircut.",Bud Smith
"Typical the work of a man with a large 'ego', looking for justification; more than any other this book has strong Romantic traits. Chateaubriand is a liberal in his principles (freedom is central), but clearly conservative in politics (his option for monarchism); perhaps that explains his marginal relevance as a historical person. But this certainly is a remarkable historical document, presenting an enchanting introspection into a turbulent mind. The most interesting pages treat about Napoleon, the passages on his own public actions are less captivating. And oh, I almost forgot: what a succinct, eloquent French he wrote!",Marc

"As I write these last words, on 16 November 1841, my window, which looks west over the gardens of the Foreign Missions, is open: it is six o'clock in the morning: I can see the pale and swollen moon; it is sinking over the spire of the Invalides scarcely touched by the first golden ray from the east: one might imagine that the old world was ending and the new beginning. I behold the light of a dawn whose sunrise I shall never see. It only remains for me to sit down at the edge of my grave: then I shall descend boldly, crucifix in hand, into eternity.
This is an excellent memoir, but it is also much more than a mere retelling of one man’s life. François-René de Chateaubriand is witness to a world in the midst of change. He observes as France goes from an old monarchy to constitutional, after the Republic follows Napoleon and finally a return to monarchy again. Melancholic musings on his childhood and youth convey the slow but sure decay of old rites and customs—ultimately finding its climax in the violence of the French Revolution. Tragedy is on every page, as his family members and acquaintances are sent to the guillotine, or when his sister and childhood companion dies. There is a sombre beauty in the manner in which he dualizes some events of the past, showing them as they appeared to him at the time but equipped with future knowledge. The smile of Marie-Antoinette is paired with the memory of him identifying her jaw-bone in a mass grave.
The memoir stands as a witness to history and a witness to a dying world and it catches a glimpse of what new order is to come. It is also a portrait of personal tragedy, of the melancholy of one man and his attempts to grasp life at its core. The writing is hauntingly beautiful at times, with Romantic renderings of nature and a tender understanding of the human soul.",Nadia
"For an understanding of the romantic temperament that shaped so much mid-19th century European literature, art and music, Chateaubriand's ""Memoirs from beyond the Tomb"" is a good place to start. The title itself envisions a writer, now nothing more than dust, speaking from beyond the grave--a reminder to us, I suppose, of where we will soon enough be (in case we need a reminder!). A common enough perspective, I suppose, but the living author who has become a dead author, in this case Chateaubriand, repeatedly contemplates his future death as preferable to his melancholy, unhappy life. In his construction of things, despite all the good moments--he loved food, took as a lover Madame Récamier, a woman of stunning beauty (see the Francois Gerard portrait), spent time in positions of political importance in London and Rome, traveled to the United States where he claims to have met George Washington, became famous as a writer during his lifetime, etc.--he insists his life was exceedingly bleak. No number of good moments, it seems compensates for the general melancholy of mortality, at least in the eyes of the genuine romantic. This all might seem quite passé, but it remains instructive for those of us who want to understand the past--for some of us not just the 19th century but an earlier time in our own lives when we might, alas, have cherished just such ideas. But this book is much more than just a monument to the Romantic Movement. Chateaubriand, born only twenty days after Napoleon and seeing himself as somehow linked to the complex conqueror, writes of the march to Moscow and back, as well as many other Napoleonic adventures, with great shrewdness and real ambivalence. His account becomes a rich history of his own age; a history told from the perspective of a royalist with, I am sure he would insist, genuine democratic tendencies. A rewarding, important, and at times beautifully written book.",Stephen Durrant
"simply loved this. One of those books that you internalise and stays with you. His childhood! His forbidding father pacing the room from the fire to the end plunged in darkness, in silence! Those encounters with Napoleon. That occasion when the Napoleonic army crosses the river into Russia and he hears music, like in Antony and Cleopatra, the god of war whom he loved now leaving him. Heaven.",Fazackerly Toast
"Whoops, turns out I don’t know French. But someday I might. I’m keeping this little book around for that day.",Mia
"An absorbing memoir of a man who led a most intriguing life. Moving from his early childhood through the various phases of his life, this autobiography reveals many of his personal characteristics and aspirations during a very interesting period of French history.",Bill
Such a great book!!,Maan Kawas
"A very smart man with a sharp quill. Probably one of my first literary love. I fancied the man who'd written such things, lived such a life. Damn he's got some ego, but mostly well deserved.
His memoirs are an amazing glimpse in the life and politics of some of the richest and most turbulent decades of french history.",Elenora
I felt like I belonged in the Tombe after reading this ponderous book.,Marianne
"Literally ""Memoirs from Beyond the Grave"" is an autobiography in 42 volumes. The version I read had volumes 9-12, covering life and travels from April to September 1822, revised in December 1846.",D
"over rated. poor little rich kid grows up , flees france to save his head from the revolution. very self absorbed ponce.",Stosch
"I was handicapped by lack of knowledge of French history, but I found the sections about Napoleon amazing.",Pam Strachan
"The more I read books like this, the more I find that I enjoy them. The Education of Henry Adams, Confessions of an Italian (Ippolito Nievo), Remembrance of Things Past (Marcel Proust) and Memoirs from Beyond the Tomb to me are of the same family. Also his view of Napoleon and the misery he caused which is decidedly not the same as the monuments and street names all over Paris commemorating Napoleon.
True happiness is not expensive; if it costs dear, then it is of an inferior nature. pg. 34
Mathematics, Greek, and Latin occupied the whole of my winter at school. What time was not devoted to study was given up to those childhood games which are the same all over the world. The little English boy, the little German, the little Italian, the little Spaniard, the little Iroquois, and the little Bedouin all bowl the hoop and throw the ball. Brothers of one great family, children lose their common features only when they lose their innocence, which is the same everywhere. Then the passions, modified by climates, governments, and customs, create different nations; the human species ceases to speak, and understand the same language; society is the real Tower of Babel. pgs. 42-43
The man who tries to take his own life shows not so much the vigour of his soul as the feebleness of his nature. pg. 69
I shall never achieve success in this life, precisely because I lack one passion and one vice: ambition and hypocrisy. pg. 71
How rapidly and how often we change our illusions and our way of life! Friends leave us, others take their place; our relationships alter: there is always a time when we possessed nothing of what we now possess, and a time when we have nothing of what we once had. Man does not have a single, consistent life: he has several laid end to end, and that is his misfortune. pg. 72
Then, like Adam after his sin, I went forth into unknown country, and the world was all before me. pg. 73
[i]t is not man that stops time, it is time that stops man. pg. 76
There is a melancholy pleasure in meeting people we have known at different periods of our life and in considering the changes which have occurred in their existence and ours. Like markers left behind us, they trace the way we have come through the desert of the past. pg. 82
One has seen nothing if one has never seen the pomp of Versailles ... pg. 88
Louis XVI could have answered his judges as Christ answered the Jews: 'Many good works I have shown you; for which of those works do you stone me?' pg. 89
When, before the Revolution, I read the history of public disturbances among various nations, I could not understand how it was possible to live in those times; ....The Revolution made me understand the possibility of living in such conditions. pgs. 106-107
I cannot depict the society of 1789 and 1790 better than by comparing it with the architecture of the time of Louis XII and François I, when the Greek orders began to be combined with Gothic style.... pg. 107
Philadelphia offers a monotonous appearance. In general, what is missing from the Protestant cities of of the United States is great work of architecture: the Reformation, young in years, and sacrificing nothing to the imagination, ha rarely erected those domes, those airy naves, those twin towers with which the old Catholic religion ha crowned Europe. Not a ingle monument in Philadelphia, New York, or Boston soars above the mass of walls and roofs: the eye is saddened by this uniform level. pg. 131
At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in 1685, the same mob from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine demolished the Protestant church at Charenton with just as much zeal as when it laid waste the church of Saint-Denis in 1793. pg. 133
A notable example of the concatenation of human affairs: a finance Bill passed by the English Parliament in 1765 creates a new empire on this earth in 1782, and causes one of the oldest kingdoms of Europe to disappear from the world in 1789! pg. 137
The earth is a charming mother; we come forth from her womb; in childhood, she hold us to her breasts, which are swollen with milk and honey; in youth and manhood, she lavishes upon us her cool waters, her harvests, and her fruits; she offers us, wherever we may go, shade, a bath, a table, and a bed; when we die, she opens her bosom to us again and throws a coverlet of grass and flowers over our remains while she secretly transforms us into her own substance to be reproduced in some new and graceful shape. pg. 150
Fortune and I took a dislike to each other at first sight. pg. 156

Cicero was right to recommend reading as an antidote to the sorrows of existence. pg. 186
Mme. de Beaumont passed along the road which all of us have to take. pg. 216
...when all tremble before the tyrant, and it is as dangerous to incur his favour a to merit his displeasure, the historian appears, entrusted with the vengeance of the nations. Nero prospers in vain, for Tacitus has already been born within the Empire; pgs. 220-221
Let us be gentle if we would be regretted; great genius and superior qualities are mourned only by the angels. pg. 227
Posterity is not as fair in its judgments as is usually maintained; there are passions, infatuations, and errors born of distance just as there are passions and errors born of proximity. When posterity admires unreservedly, it is shocked that the contemporaries of that man it admires should not have had the same opinion of that man as itself. This is easy to explain, however: the things which caused offence in that person are past; his infirmities have died with him; all that remains of him is his imperishable life; but the evil which he caused is nonetheless real for all that; evil in itself and its essence, and evil above all for those who endured it. pg. 267
The Allies did not defeat us: we ourselves, choosing between two scourges, gave up shedding our blood, which had ceased to flow for our freedom. pg. 268
Do two perjuries add up to loyalty? pg. 281
An Irish Protestant, a British general with no understanding of our history or our way life, a man who saw nothing in the French year of 1793 but the English antecedent of 1649, was given the task of deciding our fate! Bonaparte's ambition had brought us to this sorry pass. pg. 288
I refuse to behave like a simpleton and fall into a fit of admiration. pg. 303 (about Napoleon)
Posterity will not ask .... whether Napoleon was justly punished for his crimes, but whether England showed the generosity befitting a great country. pg. 311
At the present time, everything disintegrates in a day; whoever lives too long dies alive. pg. 312
Man is as much deceived by the success of wishes as by their disappointment. pg. 327
When a man looks at or listens to his past life, he seems to see on a deserted sea the wake of a vessel that has vanished; he seems to hear the tolling of a bell whose old tower is lost from sight. pg. 327
We do not like a man to despise what we worship, and to think himself entitled to insult the mediocrity of our life. pg. 329
Prosperity does not recognize her sister Adversity. Thus do illusions, shattered for one, begin again for another; thus do the fickle destinies of human life pass each other on the windswept waves: happy or baleful, the same abyss carries them and engulfs them. pgs. 341-342
Death takes no account of what we may have been. pg. 343
The talent which expires impresses one more than the individual who dies: it is a general grief that afflict society; everyone suffer the same loss at the same time. pg. 345
When a man has been reunited with his destiny, he imagines that he has never left it; life, according to Pythagoras, is nothing but a reminiscence. pg. 346
Death seems to have been born in Rome. pg. 353
I was expected to sacrifice myself on the spot to Liberalism, to the doctrine which had constantly attacked me; I was expected to run the risk of shaking the legitimate throne in order to win the praises of a few cowardly enemies who had not the whole-hearted courage to starve, pg. 358
This is the way in which the English, who live a sheltered life on their island, take revolution to other nations; you find them in the four corners of the world mixed up in quarrels which are no concern of their: provided they can sell a piece of calico, what do they care if thy plunge a nation into calamity? What right had this Mr. Folks to shoot at French soldiers? Was it the British Constitution that Charles X had violated? pg. 360",John
"The man certainly knows how to tell a story - the premise being living through the birth of America, the French Revolution, Napoleon's rise and fall, and finally the last gasps of the monarchy in France. His presents himself as one weathering countless ideology & political storms, staying true to his own beliefs. It's a little funny to hear him talk so much about a love of liberty contra Napoleon just after he denounced the Terror (which spilt the blood of his family in the name of liberty). As a thinker he's not so interesting - just a standard reactionary who believes it is good to be well off and religious (and those less well off should grit their teeth and bear it).",Paul
