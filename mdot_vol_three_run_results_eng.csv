"With confinement (COVID 2020), it’s been a good time for me to exhume some long idling books in my collection. And so I stumble upon the Chateaubriand tomes that have been sitting on the shelf for years. About 15 years ago I read Tome II (only one I owned at the time). I didn’t remember much about it, but since I now had the others I figured ok let’s hit up volume III and see what’s up with this Frenchie (in hindsight this was a mistake).
In Chateaubriand’s memoirs a lot of stuff happens, but it’s honestly boring AF. Endless minutiae involving diplomacy (he was a diplomat for large portions of his public career), so many namedrops I can’t see straight. Tons of backstabbing BS between aristocrats (kind of fun but wears after a while). Intermittently we get some fun melancholic tangents where Chateaubriand waxes eloquent about the awfulness of life (yay!). But serious, those are the best written parts. Life is @#%# up and we can all relate to that.
It’s funny to compare with Proust (who I do think was influenced by Chateaubriand in certain respects), with Proust very little happens but it is way more fascinating. Somehow Proust makes the analysis of paint drying interesting.
The most interesting part in this Chateaubriand volume was the final 50 pages involving the downfall of Charles X. People are backstabbers. Hearing tales of their petty villainy kind of amusing.
Chateaubriand's political views are confusing. A mix of royalist and republican, often confused, he takes on what to me seem like extraordinarily dissonant positions. At heart I think he was a republican who was struggling to transcend the yoke of his class acculturation.
As I alluded to in first paragraph, mistake I made is I prob should’ve read Tome I. Reading up on Chateaubriand, consensus seems to be that is the most interesting volume: involves C’s exile, French revolution, his voyage to the US, fake meeting with Washington, soldiering, etc. I may hit that volume up eventually out of curiosity. But for now am tapped out on this guy. Recommend this volume only for hardcore Frenchyphiles (with a mild sadomasochistic streak).",Sebastien
"“Trois catastrophes ont marqué les trois parties précédentes de ma vie: j’ai vu mourir Louis XVI pendant ma carrière de voyageur et de soldat; au bout de ma carrière littéraire, Bonaparte a disparu; Charles X, en tombant, a fermé ma carrière politique.”
This third volume is thus organised around Chateaubriand’s political career during the French Restoration. Partisan of a strong constitutional monarchy, he is one of the main champion of the liberal Charter of 1814. Successively minister of Foreign affairs and ambassador in London, Berlin and Rome, he delivers in his memoirs a very broad overview of the main geopolitical events of turbulent times in European history: the French expedition in Spain to restore King Ferdinand VIII - main accomplishment of his ministry - but also the Ottoman occupation of Greece, the Russo-Turkish war of 1828, the election of Pope Pius VIII and the July revolution in France, of which he gives a vivid and detailed account.
There is also much grandiloquence in those memoirs- “Je n’avais pas bravé Bonaparte pour être intimidé par M Decazes.”- a style that seems to be borrowed from the 17th Century foremost religious preachers such as Bossuet and a tragic conception of the human condition that owes to Pascal.
Chateaubriand is indeed a 17th Century man. Unremittingly he quotes Racine, Molière, La Fontaine, conjures up La Bruyère, alludes to Pascal, imitates Bossuet or remembers cardinal de Retz. He loathes the 18th Century with its seductive frivolity, its atheistic materialism, and probably mostly because it is the Century that gave birth to the Revolution during which most members of his family were slaughtered.
The account of political events alternate with meditations on transience, mortality and vanity of all things human. The memory of History is a perpetual reminder of death. If Rome, where layers of disappeared civilisations appear in full view at every corner, is the perfect city to meditate on vanity, London also inspires him those thoughts:
“Que sont devenus ces jours éclatants et tumultueux où vécurent Shakespeare et Milton, Henri VIII et Elisabeth, Cromwell et Guillaume, Pitt et Burke? Tout cela est fini; supériorités et médiocrités, haines et amours, félicités et misères, oppresseurs et opprimés, bourreaux et victimes, rois et peuples, tout dort dans le même silence et dans la même poussière.”
This sharp consciousness of mortality and this ideal of detachment from all passions and mundane things fit in with the autobiographical project to address the reader with a voice as if coming from beyond the grave. The book and its writer become thus for the reader the ultimate memento mori.
“Lecteur, si tu t’impatientes de ces citations, de ces récits, songe d’abord que tu n’as peut-être pas lu mes ouvrages et qu’ensuite je ne t’entends plus; je dors dans la terre que tu foules: si tu m’en veux, frappe cette terre du pied, tu n’insulteras que mes os.”",Mila
"The first chapters of this third volume of Chateaubriand's memoirs seemed less interesting than the previous volumes, but then it gained momentum and I really enjoyed it. Chateaubriand was a fascinating mixture of a conservative with some progressive ideas, guess today he would have been a social-democrat. I totally disagree with his monarchic and religious views, but his writing is superb, and he can really bring life to his depictions of diplomatic and political life in the 19th century, so similar to our own times in so many ways - some things never change? And his account of the July Revolution is extremely lively.",Paulo Santos
